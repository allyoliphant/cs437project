"Sadie Crawford

Sadie Crawford (1885-1965), also known as Sadie Johnson and Sadie Mozee, was a British-American performer of the early jazz era, one of the few white female performers of her day to have enjoyed an international career.

Based for the last 35 years of her life in Washington, D.C., United States, she was born Louisa Harriet Marshall in Tooting, London on 27 December 1885. The youngest of the seven children of Francis Thomas Marshall and his wife Ellen Maria, she maintained a close bond with her siblings and their families throughout her life. The household in which she grew up was a somewhat unconventional one: her father, a removal-man, died just before her seventh birthday, and shortly afterwards her mother Ellen began a relationship with a man some 20 years her junior, Louis Slade, with whom in 1892 she went on to have one further child. Ellen and Louis finally married in 1905, four years before Ellen’s death. Most of Louisa’s siblings lived their adult lives in south London. Throughout her life she remained particularly close to her eldest sister Mrs Rhoda Matilda Newbon, who was mother to 13 children.

Sadie took to the stage in London in her mid teens, and it is clear that early on she developed a taste for black popular culture, and music in particular. She would marry twice; both her husbands were black Americans. Numerous photographs suggest that she went out of her way to present herself as a 'black', 'coloured' or 'creole' woman, presumably feeling this would give her greater appeal as a performer, and several newspaper articles also suggest that her origins were more exotic than they really were. Throughout her career she seems to have used professionally the forename Sadie, although the origins of this stage name are not known.

Various sources allow us to piece together Sadie’s career. Not least among these is a short account of her life that she herself wrote in 1960 in her mid 70s. From this we learn that she left school at 11 (working initially as a domestic servant) and within a few years was employed as a dancer at London’s Empire Theatre. Her first big break came with an invitation from the American entertainer Laura Hampton (née Bowman) to join her review troupe, following which she was signed up for a European tour of the show 'A Trip to Coontown'. 
Sadie met her first husband, saxophonist Adolph Crawford, in 1906 and was soon working with him as a vaudeville music hall double act, although at this time she was using the name Sadie Johnson. In the years leading up to the First World War the duo can be found performing in Russia, Bucharest, the Balkan States and Scandinavia, as well as Berlin and Paris, and in the war years all corners of the United Kingdom.

Sadie and Adolph finally married in Southwark in June 1918, just as the jazz craze was sweeping across Europe. Their international careers started to take off in earnest at this time, with invitations to tour the world pouring in. In the post-war years they can be found as far afield as New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil, in addition to Austria, Hungary, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Paris, very much the European capital of jazz with so many resident and ad hoc bands and orchestras, became an important base for the duo.

It was in Paris in the early 1920s that the few recordings to feature them (as part of Gordon Stretton’s ‘Orchestre Syncopated Six’) were made by Pathé; it was also at the American Hospital of Paris, Neuilly-sur-Seine, that Adolph Crawford died in 1929.

Within a few months of Adolph's death Sadie sailed to New York City with Lew Leslie's ‘Blackbirds’ and it was in the United States that she thereafter settled. After suffering a nervous breakdown she was advised to go to Saratoga Springs to recuperate and it was there she met her second husband Frank Mozee (a chauffeur, some 16 years younger than she was), whom she married in 1930, when she would have been 44. Sadie and Frank made their home in Washington D.C. and it seems that her second marriage effectively marked the end of her stage career. From America she regularly visited her family back in Tooting (in the early years by boat but latterly by plane), staying at the Regent Palace Hotel in central London. Although she had no children of her own, Sadie was ‘foster mother’ to a daughter, Lillian Brown.
Sadie Mozee died at Washington’s District of Columbia General Hospital on 18 December 1965, a few days short of her 80th birthday, the Washington ""Evening Star"" revealing in her obituary notice that her death occurred ‘after a long illness’. The article also states that she was a member of St Martin’s Catholic Church and that she is buried in Washington's Mount Olivet Cemetery. Her husband Frank died in Washington D.C. in 1981.",Sadie_Crawford,11

""Say Man"" is a song by American musician Bo Diddley. Written under his real name of Ellas McDaniel, it was recorded by Bo Diddley in 1959 and released as a single on Checker 931. 

The recording became his biggest US pop hit, reaching number 20 on the Hot 100, and number three on the R&B chart. It arose from a jam session between Diddley and his maracas player Jerome Green, and featured Diddley and Green trading insults. 

Bo Diddley said of the song: ""A lot of the things I did in the Chess studios, we were just goofin' around... They played it back, and it shocked all of us! Of course, they cut out all the dirty parts."" Music critic Maury Dean, while rejecting the idea that the track is ""the first rap song"", says that it is ""the first major soul tune to feature a total spoken patter of pal put-downs to a rockin' beat... Bo's lightning right hand chops chords like sugar cane. The incessant beat throbs into the hot American evening nocturne of streetwise savvy. Rap - with a side of ghetto-blast humor.""

"Palazzo Fraccia

Palazzo Fraccia is a mansion located in the town centre of Alcamo, in the province of Trapani.

This palace was built by Agostino Fraccia, baron of Favarotta and Furni since 1697, in order to have a mansion fiiting to the new social position he had acquired from his noble family; it can certainly be considered one of the most beautiful civil buildings built in the 18th century in Alcamo.

On the Baroque style façade there are eight entrances on the ground floor: the central one is full of decorations; the portal, made with travertine, owing to the restoration of the road, has a raised bottom with simple pedestals, two capitals and a lowered arch (finely decorated at its arrises), surmounted by two brackets with leaf and fruit decorations, supporting the balcony of honour.

The portal of the balcony is also rich with baroque decorations, with two pilasters, other garnitures on both sides, ending with three masks, the biggest one in the middle; the family emblem dominates the tympanum: it is formed by a heart confixed by an arrow and surmounted by the baronial crown.

The other five balconies on the first floor are made with carved stone; the brackets are fluted and have some decorations; on the second floor there are five stone balconies, two windows and two recent balconies. 

As soon as you enter the lobby, there is an atrium: today, of the two ancient staircases, there is only the one leading to the first floor; in the late 19th century they built another staircase leading up to the second floor.

The palace is situated between the Church of Saint Nicholas of Bari (along corso 6 Aprile) and via Porta Stella, where there are two other entrances on the first floor, leading to its eight rooms with accessories, and to the ten rooms existing on the second floor.

The terrace dominates the Church, with a recent balcony which was added in the last century; during the 1950s the building has changed its ownership from the marquess Patti di Santa Rosalia to the families Manno, La Colla, Lucchese and Ippolito.",Palazzo_Fraccia,19

Sampur Soodaikudah archaeological site is a historic site with archaeological evidences, situated in Mathalamalai mountain, Sampur, Sri Lanka. The site was discovered by a group of archaeologists, during an archaeological excavation done in the Sampur area in December 2017. However the ruins, including an old Stupa were completely destroyed and flattened out by a group of vandals on 18 December, few days after the discovery.

During the Sri Lankan civil war, many of the archaeological sites in the North and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka were not properly investigated or recorded as the prevailed threats from the LTTE rebel group. After the defeat of LTTE in 2009, the archaeology department carried out several projects across the North & Eastern provinces to investigate and identify the places with archaeological evidences and the some of places were finally declared as archaeologically protected reserves and monuments. As the instructions given by Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, a similar project was started after the 2015 to investigate the unknown archaeological sites in the Eastern province of the country. In December 2017, as a part of the project a group of archaeologists unearthed a dilapidated Stupa during an excavation done in a Hindu temple premises in Soodaikudah in Sampur. According to the initial evaluations done by the archaeologists, the Stupa is a construction of early Anuradhapura period (377 BC to 1017 AD) with a girth of 15 feet.

The ruins of the stupa were found on land which is used by a recently built Hindu shrine. The local people in Soodaikudah are said to be displaced in 2006 along with Muttur people and had been resettling around the area from 2013. The Hindu shrine, constructed near to the stupa mound, was officially registered in 2014.

A few days after the identification, the Stupa mound had been cleared completely by a group of people using a bulldozer before the Department declared it as an archaeologically and historically important site. The destruction was first revealed by police who conducted investigations following a tip-off given on the police hotline. The incident was reported to the authorities including the Secretary to the President and the Eastern Province Governor by the chief monk of Seruvila Mangala Raja Maha Vihara. A police investigation was started following the incident and meanwhile a court order was issued by the Muttur magistrate, suspending all rehabilitation works on the Hindu temple.

On 23 December, the speaker Karu Jayasuriya revealed that the people who destroyed the Soodaikudah Stupa in Sampur has been identified. A few days after the statement, three people were arrested with a bulldozer and a lorry which were used to destroy the Stupa. The bulldozer had been brought to the Hindu shrine to dig a drinking well around 100 metres away from the Kovil but they had used the vehicle to destroy the Stupa. Local media reported that the two drivers involved in the destruction of the Stupa had met with accidents at different places on the same day. 

On 29 December the Department of Archaeology announced that they will take over the entire land area, where the Sudaikuda Stupa was located for further preservation. In January police arrested three senior members of the Hindu temple board who had connected with the incident.",Sampur_Stupa,26

"William A. Smalley

William Allen Smalley (April 4, 1923December 16, 1997) was an American linguist. He is best known for his role in the development of the Romanized Popular Alphabet for the Hmong language.

William A. Smalley was born in 1923 in Jerusalem, where his parents worked as missionaries of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. He and his family remained there until 1934, at which time they returned to the United States.

In 1941, he matriculated in Houghton College, where he developed an interest in anthropology, which he saw as relevant to missionary work. After graduating from Houghton in 1945 with a degree in English literature, he attended the Missionary Training Institute (1945–46) and received linguistic training in Bible translation at the Summer Institute of Linguistics at the University of Oklahoma (1946, 1947). In 1946, he also enrolled in Columbia University's graduate program in anthropology with an emphasis on linguistics.

In 1950, the Christian and Missionary Alliance sent him to the southern region of Vietnam, where he worked on problems of language analysis. The following year, he was sent to Luang Prabang in Laos in order to analyse Khmu and prepare lessons in the language for other missionaries.

In Laos, he met Reverend G. Linwood Barney and Father Yves Bertrais, and together they began working on a writing system for the Hmong language, which had until then been unwritten. The system they developed became known as the Romanized Popular Alphabet, and it is today the most widely used Hmong writing system. Yang Dao, the assistant director of the English Language Learner Project of the St. Paul Public Schools, has said: ""I cannot value his work. … It is invaluable. This writing system helped us to preserve our culture and tradition and history. Now it is used by Hmong all over the world.""

In 1954, the outbreak of the Laotian Civil War forced him and his wife to return to the United States. There he completed his dissertation on the Khmu language, for which he was awarded a doctorate by Columbia in 1956. (In 1961, an abbreviated version of his dissertation was published by the American Oriental Society.)

From 1954 onwards, he worked primarily in Southeast Asia as a translation consultant and coordinator for the American Bible Society and its parent organization, United Bible Societies. The nature of his work meant that he twice took up residence in Thailand, first from 1962 to 1967 and then again from 1969 to 1972.

He was the editor of ""Practical Anthropology"" (now known as ""Missiology"") from 1955 to 1968 and an associate editor of ""The Bible Translator"" from 1957 to 1959.

In 1977, after twenty-three years with the American Bible Society and United Bible Societies, he decided to leave. Unable to find employment, he worked for a time at a discount toy store.

In 1978, he relocated to St. Paul, Minnesota, to accept a position as Professor of Linguistics at Bethel University. To his surprise, he discovered that many thousands of Hmong refugees were also settling in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul area.

As an Honorary Fellow with the University of Minnesota Southeast Asia Refugee Studies Program, he took part in a project studying Hmong adaptation to life in the United States, publishing 'Adaptive Language Strategies of the Hmong: From Asian Mountains to American Ghettos' (1985) and 'Stages of Hmong Cultural Adaptation' (1986).

He also studied the different Hmong scripts that had been developed after the Romanized Popular Alphabet, in particular the Pahawh Hmong script, which was created in Laos in 1959 by Shong Lue Yang. With Chia Koua Vang and Gnia Yee Yang, he wrote two books about Pahawh Hmong and its creator: ""Mother of Writing: The Origin and Development of a Hmong Messianic Script"" and ""The Life of Shong Lue Yang: Hmong “Mother of Writing”"" (both published in 1990).

From 1983 to 1992, he was an associate editor of ""Language Sciences"".

In 1985 and 1986, he once again lived in Thailand, this time as a Fulbright research fellow researching the different languages and dialects of the country. His book ""Linguistic Diversity and National Unity: Language Ecology in Thailand"" (1994) has been described by the Thai scholar David Smyth as ""a masterful study of the relationship between the national language, regional dialects and minority languages"".

He retired from Bethel University in 1987, but continued to write extensively in his retirement.

He died of a heart attack at the age of seventy-four.",William_A__Smalley,31

"Memphis Bound

Memphis Bound (usually styled Memphis Bound!) is a 1945 American musical based on the Gilbert and Sullivan opera ""H.M.S. Pinafore"". The score was adapted and augmented by Don Walker and Clay Warnick, with a libretto credited to Albert Barker and Sally Benson, ""with gratitude to W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan."" The original production starred an all-black cast including Bill ""Bojangles"" Robinson, Avon Long, Billy Daniels, Ada Brown, and Sheila Guyse.

An all-African-American touring company is traveling to Memphis on a showboat, the ""Calliboga Queen"". When the boat is run aground in Tennessee, the company mounts a production of Gilbert and Sullivan's ""H.M.S. Pinafore"" to raise funds to get it unstuck. Much of the musical consists of a play within a play, as the company presents a musically updated version of the Gilbert and Sullivan opera; the boat pilot (played by Bill Robinson in the original production) takes a major role as Sir Joseph Porter, First Lord of the Admiralty. Another actor (Avon Long in the original) sings and dances the role of Captain Corcoran, while the part of Josephine goes to an Andrews Sisters-style trio of women from the company chorus (Sheila Guyse, Ida James, and Thelma Carpenter)—each had been promised the role, so they join forces and play it simultaneously. The police arrest the company for performing without a license, and the case is taken to court in a scene involving excerpts from another Gilbert and Sullivan work, ""Trial by Jury"".

In 1939, Robinson had starred as the Lord High Executioner in Mike Todd's musical ""The Hot Mikado"", based on Gilbert and Sullivan's ""The Mikado"" (another updated version, ""The Swing Mikado"", opened on Broadway almost simultaneously). ""Memphis Bound"" marked his return to Broadway, in another vehicle based on Gilbert and Sullivan. John Wildberg, who had successfully presented Philip Yordan's ""Anna Lucasta"" with an African-American cast on Broadway the previous year, was producer; Robert Ross directed, assisted by Eva Jessye, with Vinton Freedley credited for ""personal supervision"" of the show. ""Memphis"", one of numerous Second World War-era Broadway musicals created by white production teams for black casts, was the last such show to appear during the war.

Most of the score was derived from the Gilbert and Sullivan original; the vocal arrangements and updated lyrics were by Clay Warnick, while the orchestrations and score were adapted by Don Walker. The show also included four original songs by Warnick and Walker—""Big Old River,"" ""Stand Around the Bend,"" ""Old Love and Brand New Love,"" and ""Growing Pains""—written in a pastiche of existing styles. (In the show billing, Walker was credited with the new music, and Warnick and Walker shared credit for the new lyrics.) ""Growing Pains,"" an original duet for Robinson and 8-year-old actor Timothy Grace, was strongly flavored by a Duke Ellington sound, while the Gilbert and Sullivan material was arranged as swing music with a boogie-woogie edge. 

Robinson interpolated his specialty, a dance on stairs, as a high point of the show. Avon Long, known for playing Sportin' Life in the 1942 Broadway production of ""Porgy and Bess"", provided additional solo dancing, using a full-body movement style contrasting with Robinson's foot-based work.

The show opened at the Broadway Theatre on May 24, 1945. John Chapman of the ""New York Daily News"" gave the show a rave review, saying ""It has been too many years since I have seen a musical with the zip, the stomp, and the whoosh of ""Memphis Bound"". … It's good-naured as a puppy, and frequently very smart."" Wilella Waldorf of the ""New York Post"" was more critical of the book, commenting that though the adaptation of ""H.M.S. Pinafore"" was ""interesting musically and often very funny,"" the show as a whole was inconsistent, with ""no uniform pattern … set for the travesty."" ""Life"" magazine's anonymous critic highlighted the contributions of Robinson and ""H.M.S. Pinafore"", noting with amusement that both were 67 years old, but added that when neither were featured onstage, ""the show gets very dreary."" Bob Francis of ""Billboard"" magazine similarly praised the ""Pinafore"" segments and the stars over the original elements of the book, commenting: ""If two actors could put ""Memphis"" over for a smash, it should be Robinson and Long. Unfortunately, the task is too heavy for a two-man job."" Critics widely praised Robinson's performance and especially his dancing.

During its run, ""Memphis"" moved from the Broadway to the Belasco Theatre. It closed on June 23, 1945, after 36 performances, losing money on its original investment. The show was hampered in part due to competition from ""Hollywood Pinafore"", a George S. Kaufman musical comedy drawing on exactly the same Gilbert and Sullivan material. However, Kaufman's version, which opened exactly a week after ""Memphis"", was a much more pronounced critical failure.

""The Nightingale, The Moon and I,"" one of the numbers closely based on a Gilbert and Sullivan original, was recorded in the 1990s for the compilation album ""Life's a Funny Present"".",Memphis_Bound,33

"Petersberg Citadel

Petersberg Citadel (German:""Zitadelle Petersberg"") in Erfurt, central Germany, is one of the largest
and best preserved town fortresses in Europe. The citadel was built on Petersberg hill, in the north-western part of the old town centre from 1665, when Erfurt was governed by the Electorate of Mainz. It is surrounded by over two kilometres of stone walls and is 36 hectares in size.

Erfurt has also been ruled by Sweden, Prussia, Napoleon, the German Empire, the Nazis, and post-World War II Soviet occupying forces, and it was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). All of these regimes used Petersberg Citadel and had an influence on its development. The baroque fortress was in military use until 1963. Since German reunification in 1990, the citadel has undergone significant restoration and it is now open to the public as an historic site. Its maze of underground passageways are also open to vistors and the fortress bakery (1832) is again in working order.

The fortress is also known by its French name, ""Citadelle Petersberg"", as French troops were stationed there from 1806 to 1814, when Erfurt was under Napoleonic occupation. Napoleon visited Erfurt several times and the citadel was further developed during his rule, although parts of it were damaged in a battle in 1813.

The citadel was built on the site of a medieval Benedictine Monastery and the earliest parts of the complex date from the 12th century.

The former lower barracks (German:""Untere Kaserne"") building is now used to house and administer archives of the Stasi, the Ministry for State Security of the former German Democratic Republic.

The , is a smaller fortress to the south-west of Erfurt city centre, which dates from 1480. It is now the home of the German Horticulture Museum. During the Napoleonic period a hidden trench connecting the two citadels was built. The remains of this connection can still be seen at the Cyriaksburg Citadel today.

Petersberg Citadel is entwined with the history of Erfurt. The city was first mentioned in 742 in a letter from St Boniface to Pope Zachary, when the Catholic Diocese of Erfurt was established. It was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and was brought into the Diocese of Mainz in 755. The earliest archaeological find from the middle ages on Petersberg
hill is a coin dating from c.850, from the time of Lothair I, Holy Roman Emperor from 817 to 855. It was found in a grave, in the mouth of the deceased.

The oldest surviving building in the citadel is the Peterskirche (St. Peters Church), which was part of the Benedictine
Monastery of St Peter and Paul, after which the hill, and subsequently the citadel, was named. The first recorded evidence of the monastery is from 1060,
but it may have existed a considerable time before that.The original buidling was burnt down in 1080, but was rebuilt from 1103 to 1147 and St Peter's Church is from this second period.

The city gradually grew more independent during the 12th century, and in 1217 it became fully independent with the founding of its own city council. From 1066 until 1873 the old town of Erfurt was encircled by a fortified wall. About 1168 this was extended to run around the western side of Petersberg hill, enclosing it within the city boundaries. About 1625 the city council had the city wall at the Petersberg strenghtened by building a large hornwork and two bastions. These are the bastions named Gabriel and Michael. During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), Erfurt was occupied by Swedish forces from 1631. The Swedish king, Gustav II Adolf, hoped to build a fortress on Petersberg hill, but he died in 1632 and the plans never came to fruition. However, the Swedes did strengthen the existing Bastion Gabriel in 1643. In 1664 the city and the surrounding area were conquered by the Electorate of Mainz. On 1 June 1665 the foundation stone of Petersberg Citadel was laid.

The formal first construction phase lasted from 1665-1707, following an order from Johann Philipp von Schönborn (1605-1673), Archbishop-Elector of Mainz and Bishop of Würzburg and Worms, to build the citadel. Von Schönborn had recently conquered Erfurt and wanted to build the fortress to demonstrate his power to the local population, in order to suppress any ideas of rebellion.

A plan that the Erfurt architect (c.1660-1663) had created for the Swedish king Gustav II Adolf served as a basic model for the citadel, and the work was substantially influenced by (c.1620-1701) the architect to the imperial court of Mainz.
This included the building of the walls, bastions, the ravelins called Anselm and Lotha, the main gateway (""Peterstor"") and commandant building, three barracks, which are amongs the oldest surviving barracks in Germany, and the tunnels within the walls, called ""Horchgänge"" in German, meaning the 'listening passages'.

The second construction phase was from 1707 to 1728, under the direction of the architect Maximilian von Welsch (1671-1745), who was made an imperial knight with the title ""Edler von Welsch"" for his services to architecture by Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor in 1714. Welsch put special emphasis on the reinforcement of the fortress and trench defenses.

Erfurt became part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1802, to compensate Prussia for its territories on the left bank of the Rhine that were lost to France. However, on 16 October 1806 Erfurt was handed over to French forces in what is known as the Capitulation of Erfurt, which followed the Prussian defeat in the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt.

French troops were stationed at Erfurt from 1806 to 1814, when Erfurt was under Napoleonic occupation. Napoleon arrived in the city on 23 June 1807, and created the Principality of Erfurt, which he ruled directly himself.

Napoleon visited Erfurt a number of times during the French occupation. He took a particular interest in Petersberg Citadel. He stayed in Erfurt from 27 September to 14 October 1808, when he meet with Tsar Alexander I of Russia for the Congress of Erfurt. The two leaders visited Petersberg Citadel together during the Congress.

He also went to Erfurt on 15 December 1812 on his return from Russia to France, and from 25–28 April 1813. On 21 April 1813 he had ordered that Petersberg Citadel should be strengthened and equiped so that it could support 2000 men under siege for six months. Both French troops and civilian residence of Erfurt were put to
work on the project, with over 3000 civilians working on building the ditches that surround the external walls. The work was carried both day and night, used flaming
torches to see by. During this time a hidden trench connecting Petersburg and Cyriaksburg citadels was built, the remains of which can still be seen at Cyriaksburg today.

On 4 November 1813 Prussian, Austrian and Russian forces drew in on Erfurt and sought to get the French to surrender and leave Petersberg Citadel. There was no surrender and fire was opened on the citadel on 6 November, at six o'clock in the morning. A number of buildings caught fire, including the main guardhouse, monastery building, and parts of St. Peter's Church. One hundred and twenty-one houses in the town centre below the citadel were also destroyed.

The French didn't surrender, but there was an extended truce and at the beginning of January 1814, the city of Erfurt was handed over to the Prussians, although the French troops remained in the Petersberg and Cyriaksburg citadels. When Paris was captured by allied troops in April 1814, the Napoleonic troops still remained in Petersberg citadel. It was not until 5 May 1814 that French Field Marshal Alexandre Dalton surrendered and handed the citadel over peacefully to the Prussians.

When the Prussians took back the citadel in 1814, they began a new building phase which lasted until 1868. They wanted to make the fortress ""bomb proof"", and resilent to the strength of the latest weapons. During this period they built the Defence Barracks, the fortress bakery, wells, latrines, and caponiers. A caponier is part of a fortification built in a ditch to provided covered defence to the ditch and/or access to outer parts of the fort.

After German Unification in 1871, Erfurt became part of the newly created German Empire. The threat to the city from its Saxon neighbours and from Bavaria was no longer present, so it was decided to dismantle the city walls. Only a few remnants remain today.

In June 1873 Emperor Wilhelm I gave orders for Petersberg and Cyriaksburg citadels to be be pull down, but due to lack of funds this was mostly not done. Two Ravelins (Peter and Wilhelm) and the hornwork along the walls were removed. An access road was built and Lunette I was demolished and Lunette II and Ravelin Gabriel were reduced in height. The rubble was used to fill in the ditches.

Prior to World War I there was renewed the interest in the strategic military location of Petersberg Citadel. New buildings, such as workshops, warehouses, barracks and a military detention centre were built between 1912 and 1914.

The fortress remained an important garrison position until the end of the war in 1918. After World War I, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, there was a gradual abandonment of military facilities during the Weimar Republic period. Petersberg was used for garden allotments and by the civil police, who had a detention centre, garages, workshops and stores on the site.

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, they again brought the citadel into military use. They built gun casemates, and from 1935 divisional army units, reserve army units and the district army recruitment office were based there. 

Also from 1935, the Nazis used parts of the citadel as a prison for the internment of their political enemies, such as communists and trade unionists. They were kept in a police detention centre originally built to accommodate up to 60 prisoners, but at its peak 241 internees were crowded into the facility. Many of the internees were sent directly from Petersberg citadel to concentration camps. Some were murdered by the Nazis at the citadel itself. The Nazis also had a military court at the citadel for dealing with people such as deserters, which could pronounce death sentences on those being tried, and sometimes these people were immediately executed at the citadel. Today there is a memorial to those mistreated by the Nazis at the site. 

Some war damage was sustained, including the 12th century Leonhardskirche (St Leonard's Church), which had been converted into an artillery store, being totally destroyed in an air raid.

At the end of World War II, Erfurt was liberated by American forces in April 1945, and handed over to the Soviet administration on 3 July 1945, as agreed at the Yalta Conference, held in February 1945. In 1944 a transit camp for displaced people had been established in the Defense Barracks, and this continued operating under the occupying Soviet administration after the war.

In 1949 the Soviet Occupied Zone became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). From 1947 Peterberg Citadel was used mainly for civil purposes, with barracks being used by the civil police. From 1956 until 1963 the East German Army (German: ""Nationale Volksarmee"") used the citadel and its barracks, but they then moved to new facilities on the outskirts of the city. After that the main users of site were the police, for storing equipment, and a garden allotment association. The Stasi had warehouses and workshops on the site for their motor pool until 1990. The rest of the citadel was unused and plants were allowed to naturally regrow.

After German reunification in 1990, a massive project to restore the citadel was begun. It is the largest such project undertaken by the Erfurt city council and it is funded by the city council and the Thuringian state and German federal governments. Over 300 people were temporarily employed. Most buildings added since 1868 were removed, most earlier buildings, including the 12th century St Peter's Church, were restored or stabilised, ditches were cleared and walls and bastions were repaired, the ""horchgänge"" (listening passages) were cleared, and the 1832 wood-fired fortress bakery was brought back into working order. As at January 2018, the restoration is still on-going.

The citadel is surround by 2,180 metres of stone walls, which were erected in the first building phase, beginning in 1665. They form the star-shaped ground plan of the citadel, made with eight bastions and four ravelins and are between 1.2 and 6 metres thick, and from 8 to 26 metres high. There are small look-out towers built into the walls. There are now only three ravelins as Ravelin Wilhelm was removed in the 19th century.

There are tunnels within the walls, called the ""Horchgänge"" in German, meaning the 'listening passages'. At the time the citadel was first built there were no trenches or moats beyond the wall, so the ""Horchgänge"" were constructed so that soldiers could walk through them to listen for anyone trying to tunnel into the fortress.

The Peterstor, the main entrance to the citadel, was built from 1666-1668. It was designed by Antonio Petrini and bears the coat of arms of Johann Philipp von Schönborn (1605-1673), the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz. In 1993 the two wooden portcullis were reconstructed within the double archway entrance. The script above the gateway which reads ""Citadelle Petersberg"", was installed in 1861.

The Commandant Building was built in 1669 by an Italian construction team. From 1939 to 1945 it was used as a military court by the Nazis. It was restored in 1998 and is now used by Tanztenne Petersberg, a dance school for traditional Thuringian folkdancing.

The Peterskirche, the 75 metre-long monastery church, was built between 1103 and 1147. It originally had two towers at its east end, which along with the
towers of the Erfurt cathedral and the Severikirche, dominated the city skyline. Until the end of the 13th century, Emperors of the Holy Roman Empire and German kings often held court in the church. Church synods also took place there. In November 1181 an Imperial Diet was held in the church, presided over by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I, known as ""Barbarossa"". There Barbarossa's cousin Henry the Lion submitted to the emperor's authority after several years of opposition, and ceded most of his lands. 

During the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) Erfurt was occupied from 1631 by the troops of Gustav II Adolf of Sweden. In 1632, the Swedes briefly dissolved the monastery and temporarily converted it into a Protestant monastery in 1633. After the occupation only three monks remained. The church was damaged and the treasures and stores of the monastery were plundered. The damage to the church was repaired in the first and second building phases of citadel, in 1672 and 1727. In 1765 its interior was baroqueized by Italian plasterers.

In 1803 the monastery was secularised. On 6 November 1813 Prussian troops bombarded the French occupied citadel and much of it caught fire, including the church and monastery buildings. The monastery buildings, other than the church, were later then completely removed by Prussian forces who took possession of citadel in May 1814. From 1820 the remaining church was used as a store for flour and military provisions. The towers were dismantled, a new roof was built and three storage levels were constructed inside. In spite of these alterations, the building still has traces of medieval and baroque architectural details, sculpture and paintwork, and the monumental size of the building can still be appreciated.

Since 1993 the church has been used as an exhibition space for international concrete art, i.e. art which places a strong emphasis on geometrical abstraction. It has nothing to do with concrete, the buidling material.

The Defense Barracks, by far the largest building on Petersberg Citadel, was built from 1828 to
1831 by the Prussian administration, on the site of former monastery building which had been
damage by fire in 1813 and later demolished.

The building is 167 metres long and 18.8 metres wide. The external walls are up to 2 metres
thick. It could accommodate approximately 500 soldiers and was built primarily as an artillery
position to hinder enemy access to the upper plateau of the citadel from the north.
After the unification of Germany in 1871, the building was mainly used for housing soldiers and
for storage. In 1912-1913 it was remodelled and expanded with a neo-Baroque style mansard roof and the addition of large dormer windows on both sides of the building. After this it was then able to accommodate 750 soldiers.

After the end of World War I in 1918, as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, there was gradual decline in use of military facilities in Germany. The barracks was used as residential building and as quarters for the civil police and the Freikorps Thüringen, a civilian militia army unit.

During the rearmament of the army during the Nazi period, there was renewed military use
of Petersberg citadel. From 1936 to 1938 part of the barracks was used to house the new
established Motorized Infantry Regiment no. 71, and from 1938 to 1939 as the headquaters of
the army's administrative offices. In 1944 a transit camp for displaced people was established
in the Defense Barracks, and this was continued by the occupying Soviet administration after the
war.

When the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was founded in 1949, the citadel again
was used by the military. The Defense Barracks was used to accommodate a police school, the
Kasernierte Volkspolizei (a precusor to the Nationale Volksarmee - NVA), and after 1956 newly formed NVA. After 1963 the citadel became the property of the city of Erfurt and the Defense Barracks were used for storage. It has been vacant since 2000 and there is on going discussion about how it will ultimately be restored and used.

Barracks A was built in 1675. The 94 meter long building is a terrace of four houses with separate entrances and a central portal providing access to a back courtyard. It was used as a barracks until the end of World War I in 1918. After that it was used for civilian housing. From 1935-1945 it housed the ""Wehrbezirkskommando"" (District military command headquarters). From 1945 it was an old people's home. The building was restored between 2000-2001 and it now houses a mixture of private apartments and offices.

The Lower Barracks was built c.1690. It now houses the Stasi Archive, officially the ""Bundesbeauftragt für die Stasi-Unterlagen (BStU)"". It provides exhibitions and public guided tours, in German, every third Thursday of the month.The BStU has 15 such regional archives in Germany.

The Artillery Barracks was built between 1679 and 1681. Side wings were added to the building in 1825. It was in military use until 1964, when it housed the military headquarters. It was restored 1990-1993. Administrative offices of the Thuringian department for monument protection and archaeology (Thüringische Landesamt für Denkmalpflege und Archäologie, TLDA) are now housed in the building.

The Maintenance Sergeant's quarters was built in 1530 as part of the Monastery of St Peter and Paul. From 1665, when the military took over the site, it was used as the ""Marketenderei"", in English the 'sutler's building'. The sutler was a merchant who accompanied an army in order to sell provisions to soldiers. After 1820 it became a farm yard for the Prussian garrison.

It is not known exactly when the Leonhardskirche was built, but the first mention of it was in
1185. It was originally in the romanesque style, but after the site became a fortress the windows
were altered and the building became an artillery store. It was destroyed in a World War II
air raid. In the early 1990s the foundations were exacavated and can be seen today.",Petersberg_Citadel,35

Burt Hall is a public building in Northumberland Road in Newcastle upon Tyne. It is a Grade II listed building.

Polish–Taiwanese relations refers to the bilateral relations between the Republic of Poland and the Republic of China (Taiwan).

Under the circumstance of One China policy, Poland, like majority nations in the world, doesn't recognize Taiwan as a state but only recognizes China as the sole representative. Nonetheless, relationship between two countries have expanded dramatically, and since Poland transformed into a market economy after 1990, Taiwan has been one of largest Asian investors to Poland.

Despite this, they have their representative offices in respective countries. Poland has a representative office in Taipei while Taiwan has a representative office in Warsaw.

Poland and China had established relations following the resurgence of Poland at 1919, but two countries didn't develop a strong relationship due to remoteness. After communist takeovers of both Poland and mainland China, there had been no official diplomatic mission between two states. Communist Poland only considered the newly-established People's Republic of China as the sole representative of China, while the Taiwan-relocated Republic of China was hostile to all communist factors.

Since the end of communism in 1989, Poland and Taiwan had started embracing a stronger and advocating tie. Being allies of the United States and have enjoyed a large decree of success with democratic ideals, the two nations seek to tie stronger.

"Aeroflot Flight 5484

Aeroflot Flight 5484 ( ""Reys 5484 Aeroflota"") was a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Odessa to Kazan with a stopover in Kiev that experienced loss of control followed by breaking up in the air on 29 August 1979 over the Tambov Oblast, killing all 63 people onboard. It remains the deadliest Tu-124 crash and regular passenger services with the Tu-124 were permanently suspended after the accident, but the Tu-124 was still used by the Soviet military after the accident.

The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-124V powered by two Soloviev D-20P engines, registered as CCCP-45038 to the Privolzhsk Civil Aviation Directorate of Aeroflot. At the time of the accident the aircraft had flown 23,232 flight hours and sustained 18,369 pressurization cycles.

Five crew members were aboard the flight:
The one flight attendant was Nadezhda Lobashova.

Flight 5484 departed from the stopover at Kiev-Boryspil Airport on August 28 at 23:21 Moscow time (22:21 local time) with five crew members and 58 passengers aboard, including five children. The night was clear with visibility ranging from . After takeoff the flight climbed to a cruising altitude of and maintained a speed of . At 00:23 the flight contacted Penza air traffic control to report entering their airspace. That was the last time the flight made contact with controllers. 

The flaps were extended for unknown reasons at 00:24:52 while the Tu-124 was at a speed of and flying at a heading of 65°. The crew immediately noticed the aircraft began to lose altitude and they switched off the autopilot at 00:24:43. The flaps did not retract and the position of the flaps led to the aircraft descending quickly; the crew pulled on the control column in attempt to level the aircraft, which levelled briefly before the aircraft went into a roll. The force on the control column was weakened at 00:24:52, and thereafter the flaps fully extended to 30° putting the aircraft in a steep dive that quickly exceeded the aircraft maximum safe speed of .

At 00:25:13, less than a minute after the flaps were extended, the aircraft was at an altitude of and flying at a speed of with a rate of descent of , the inboard flap tore off the right wing, followed by the outboard flaps tearing off; the Tu-124 was put into a spin rotating 45°/s (7.5 rpm). At 00:26 the damaged airliner reached an altitude of while at a speed of and a rate of descent of , putting a 5g load on the aircraft, resulting in the left wing tearing off the airliner and the fuselage breaking apart in mid-air.

The wreckage of the crash was found at 07:40 Moscow time in the town of Inokovka, on the floodplains of the Vorona River in Tambov Oblast in the Russian SFSR. The wreckage was spread across an area , with fragments of the fuselage in an area of . All 63 passengers and crew were killed in the accident, which remains the deadliest Tu-124 crash in aviation history.

The exact reason for the flaps being released at cruising altitude was not discovered because major portions of the flap control system were not found among the wreckage. The board did speculate several possible causes but produced no definitive cause for the release of the flaps in the first place. Possible causes were as described:
It is also unknown why the crew weakened their grip on the control column at 00:25:13, which led to the aircraft going into a sharp rate of descent. Possible reasons for this include:

The Tupolev Tu-124 was withdrawn from regular passenger service in the USSR, but was still used by the Soviet military. The design and placement of the switch to release the flaps was changed to prevent accidental activation of the flaps.",Aeroflot_Flight_5484,51

Mungret Abbey is a medieval friary and National Monument located in County Limerick, Ireland.

Mungret Abbey is located immediately west of Dooradoyle and northeast of Mungret College, southwest of Limerick city centre, to the south of the Shannon Estuary.

Mungret was an early monastic site, founded before AD 551 by Saint Nessan (Neasán) the Deacon. At one point there may have been as many as 1,500 monks and six churches operating.

John O'Donovan claimed a fourth-century date, predating Saint Patrick.

In 908, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King of Munster, gifted the abbey three ounces of gold and a satin chasuble.

It was plundered on four occasions in the 9th century by Vikings. High King Domnall Ua Lochlainn destroyed the monastery in 1107.

Mungret claimed episcopal status 1152, but was deemed to be too close to Limerick. 1179 the then king of Munster, Domnall Mór Ua Briain, granted the monastery to Brictius, Bishop of Limerick.

Mungret then became a parish church (built 1251−72), operated by the Augustinian Canons Regular.

Mungret Abbey church was used by the Church of Ireland until 1822. The antiquary Austin Cooper wrote about Mungret in 1781.

The building was extended and the tower, the priest's living quarters, was added during the 15th century.

Ono earned the 2017 Paul Gast Lectureship award from the European Association of Geochemistry, given to mid-career scientists who have made outstanding contributions to geochemistry.

Ono has developed an instrument that uses tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy to detect the ratio of different isotopes in a sample of methane, which can indicate the methane’s source. The instrument has enabled his group to discover the origins of methane from seafloor hot springs, and to understand the effects of microbial and atmospheric methane cycling on the isotopic composition of methane in a sample.

Ono’s team also measures sulfur isotopes to study how early microbial life impacted atmospheric and ocean chemistry. Specifically, they are looking at Archean rocks in South Africa and Western Australia that are 4 to 2.5 billion years old. They also are using sulfur isotopes to investigate sulfur cycling within mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal vent systems and sulfate reduction in the deep subsurface.

Additionally, Ono collaborates with Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor of Atmospheric Science Ronald Prinn to explore the natural and environmental sources of nitrous oxide, a powerful greenhouse gas and catalyst that destroys ozone.",Shuhei_Ono,65

Soerjaatmadja was officially crowned as Sultan who led Bantenese people on custom and culture when the celebration of the Prophet Muhammad's Mawlid at the Great Mosque of Banten, Serang. Ahmad Muhtadi Dimyathi, an influential cleric in Banten is one of the figures who confirmed Soerjaatmadja as sultan.

Soerjaatmadja was born in Plaju sub-district, Palembang, South Sumatera from Bantenese couple named Ratu Bagus Abdul Mughni Soerjaatmadja and Soepiati Soeraatmadja.

Abdul Mughni was the heir of the Sultanate of Banten, he was the son of Ratu Bagus Marjono Soerjaatmadja bin Pangeran Timur Soerjaatmadja bin Sultan Maulana Muhammad Shafiuddin. Maulana Muhammad Shafiuddin was the last sultan of Banten who ruled from 1809 to 1813. After the Banten Sultanate was abolished by the Dutch, he and his descendants were later exiled to Surabaya.

""Pengadilan Agama"" (Indonesian: the Religious Courts) of Serang through ""Surat Penetapan Ahli Waris"" (Indonesian: the Letter of Determination of the Heirs) numbered 0316 / PDT.P / 2016 / PA.SRG dated 22 September 2016 has decided that Soerjaatmadja was true the son of Ratu Bagus Abdul Mughni Soerjaatmadja who was descended from the last sultan of Banten Maulana Muhammad Shafiuddin, and as the owner of the strongest blood relation who has the right of inheritance as the successor of the Sultanate of Banten.

Soerjaatmadja is the 10th descendant of Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa of Banten through Abu Nasr Abdul Kahhar, and the 15th descendant of Sultan Maulana Hasanuddin of Banten, the first sultan of Banten.


In 1981, Soerjaatmadja married a dentist named Nina Arifai. Nina is a retired lecturer at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Indonesia. From the marriage they have four children: Ratu Ayu Primiputri Rakhmania Soerjaatmadja (Ratu Gusti), Ratu Bagus Akhmatindra Adisatria Rachman Soerjaatmadja (Prince Gusti), Ratu Bagus Raditya Hafiz Bangsawan Soerjaatmadja (Prince Adipati), and Ratu Bagus Muhammad Arief Abimanyu Soerjaatmadja (Prince Anom).

On June 12, 2010, Forum Silaturahmi Keraton Se-Nusantara under the leadership of from Surakarta Sunanate acknowledged Soerjaatmadja as the official representative of the Sultanate of Banten. In the same year, Kyai Hajji Tubagus Fathul Adzim son of Tubagus Ahmad Chatib al-Bantani handed over the mandate given by Ratu Bagus Aryo Marjono Soerjaatmadja related to the management of the Great Mosque of Banten and the Tomb of Sultan Banten in Old Banten to Soerjaatmadja as the heir of the Sultanate of Banten and is the grandson of Aryo Marjono.

Related to the handover of the mandate by Tubagus Fathul Adzim to Soerjaatmadja, historical records mention that in the early days of Indonesian Independence around 1947 there was a meeting between the heirs of the Sultanate of Banten (Ratu Bagus Aryo Marjono Soerjaatmadja), President of Indonesia (Sukarno), Sultan of Yogyakarta (Hamengkubuwono IX), and Resident of Banten (Tubagus Ahmad Chatib al-Bantani). At the meeting, Sukarno invited the heir to the throne of Banten Sultanate to lead the Banten area back, but the heir to the throne due to his responsibilities as Director of BRI (now the Governor of Bank Indonesia) entrusted Banten's leadership including the guarding and maintenance of the big family asset of Banten Sultanate to Tubagus Ahmad Chatib al-Bantani as Resident of Banten, until the time when child or grandson Marjono return to Banten.

In December 2013, Soerjaatmadja was invited by Joko Widodo as Governor of Jakarta to represent the Sultanate of Banten in the World Royal Heritage event at National Monument, Jakarta.

In 2014, Soerjaatmadja was invited as Sultan of Banten by the Sultanate of Kelantan in Malaysia, it makes the stronger recognition of him as the official heir of the Sultanate of Banten which began coming from the international community.

On February 3, 2015, Soerjaatmadja was recognized by international clerics, such as from Turkey (Sheikh Fadhil al-Jailani, descendant of Sheikh Abdul-Qadir Gilani), Syria, Kelantan-Malaysia and Pattani-Thailand, as the 18th Sultan of Banten with the title of Sultan Syarif Muhammad as-Shafiuddin Azmatkhan al-Husaini. He was also given a testament and mandate as the heir of the Sultanate who led culturally to strengthen the bond with the community, local government, and the Bantenese ulama.

Soerajaatmadja was officially crowned as the 18th Sultan of Banten with the title of Sultan Syarif Muhammad as-Shafiuddin during the celebration of the Prophet Muhammad's Mawlid at the Great Mosque of Banten, Serang, Banten, on Sunday 11 December 2016.

A series of pros and cons occurred after the establishment of Soerjaatmadja as the 18th Sultan of Banten on December 11, 2016 in Old Banten.

The Religious Courts of Serang spoke about the pros and cons of the inauguration. The court declared not to establish the title of 18th Sultan of Banten, but only set Soerjaatmadja as the heir of the descendants of the Sultanate of Banten. The Decree of the Religious Courts of Serang was numbered 0316 / PDT.P / 2016 / PA.SRG dated 22 September 2016 on the Stipulation of the Heirs.

Meanwhile, Soerjaatmadja said that the decision of the Religious Courts of Serang has established himself as the heir of the Sultanate of Banten so entitled to the title of Sultan of Banten. He invited the parties who objected to his enthronement as the 18th Sultan of Banten to file a lawsuit.
As the Sultan of Banten, he intends to embrace all parties, including those who reject the coronation himself as the Sultan of Banten. Soerjaatmadja wants to invite all to work together to rebuild the glory of the Sultanate of Banten.

Meanwhile, the Indonesian Ulema Council of Banten Province assessed the horizontal conflict that occurred on the coronation of the 18th Sultan of Banten between Soerjaatmadja as the heir of the Sultanate with the ""Kenadziran Kesultanan Banten"" was a family affair and must be resolved by way of kinship.",Syarif_Muhammad_ash_Shafiuddin_of_Banten,75

"Schooner barge

A schooner barge is a type of ship; a schooner converted as a barge. Schooner barges originated on the Great Lakes in the 1860's and were in use until World War II, although a few survived into the 1950s.

Even though steamboats were used for time-critical routes such as for passengers and mail, schooners were still economical to use for bulk cargoes such as grain, wood, or iron ore. Steam tugs were introduced on the Great Lakes that could tow one or more barges. Since old schooners were available, they could be adapted to towing service with reduced crews. When winds were favorable, the schooner barge could have one or two sails rigged to save fuel in the steam tug. Eventually schooner-rigged wooden ships were purposely built for use as barges. The concept was later extended to salt-water use, with, for example, the United States Navy converting some schooners for use as barges for coal. 

Because of rough weather and small crews, schooner barges were frequently lost from tows, set adrift during bad weather, or sunk. By the 1920's, schooner barges were no longer in practical use on the Great Lakes since steam and diesel powered ships provided better operating flexibility and safety, with lower crew costs than a tug and barges hauling the same amount of cargo.",Schooner_barge,77

"Mus-If

Mus-If (foaled 2 February 1996) was a British-bred Thoroughbred racehorse. Originally trained in Ireland, he was a top-class performer as a juvenile in 1998 when he finished second in both the Tyros Stakes and the Futurity Stakes before recording his bigget win in the Group 1 National Stakes. After failing to win as a three-year-old he was sent to the United States and gelded. Returning to the track in 2001 he made little impact in two starts but did much better in the following year when he won five races including the Henry S. Clark Stakes and C. Edmund O'Brien Stakes.

Mus-If was a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by Eurostrait Ltd. As a yearling he was consigned to the sales at Deauville in August 1997 and was bought for ₣350,000 by Hamdan Al-Maktoum's Shadwell Estate company. The colt was sent to Ireland and entered training with Dermot Weld.

He was one of the best horses sired by Lahib who won the Queen Anne Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1991. Lahib's other progeny included Super Tassa, Vicious Circle (Ebor Handicap), Last Resort (Challenge Stakes) and Late Night Out (Supreme Stakes). Mus-If's dam Navajo Love Song showed little racing ability, failing to win in seven starts. She was, however, a descendant of the French broodmare Moira (foaled 1959) who was the female-line ancestor of Dancing Maid.

Mus-If made his racecourse debut in a maiden race over six furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 18 June in which he started at odds of 7/2 and finished second by a neck to Fable after leading for most of the way. Eighteen days late he recorded his first success in a maiden over seven furlongs at the Curragh. Ridden by Mick Kinane and starting the 6/4 favourite, he took the lead three furlongs out and kept on well in the closing stages to win by a head from Globe Theatre. The colt was moved up in class for the Listed Tyros Stakes over the same course and distance on 15 August for which he started favourite but was beaten into second place by the Jim Bolger-trained filly Arctic Blue. He found another Bolger filly, St Clair Ridge, too good for him in the Group 3 Futurity Stakes two weeks later and was beaten a length and a half into second place.

In the Group 1 National Stakes over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 20 September Mus-If, with Kinane in the saddle started the 8/1 third choice in the betting behind the Acomb Stakes runner-up Coliseum and Globe Theatre. None of the other six runners had contested a Group race, making the field appear to be a poor one by Group 1 standards. The best horse in the race was probably the British-trained Royal Rebel, who later won two editions of the Ascot Gold Cup. Wearing blinkers, Mus-If went to the front from the start, opened up a clear advantage approaching the last quarter mile and held off the late challenge of Coliseum to win by a neck.

Mus-if began his second season in the Listed 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown on 18 April. He took the lead in the straight but was caught in the final strides and was beaten a head by the Aidan O'Brien-trained favourite Saffron Walden. In the Irish 2000 Guineas five week later at the Curragh he went to the front two furlongs out but was overtaken entering the final furlong and came home fourth behind Saffron Walden, Enrique and Orpen with the 2000 Guineas winner Island Sands in fifth. The colt was the dropped in class for the International Stakes over nine furlongs at the Curragh in June but finished last of the five runners behind the Henry Cecil-tranied favourite Great Dane. On his final European start, Mus-If was sent to Germany to contest the Group 2 Grosse Europcar-Meile at Cologne-Weidenpesch Racecourse on 25 September. He was made the 3/5 favourite but came home fourth behind the four-year-old El Divino.

At the end of his European racing career Mus-If was sent to the United States where he was ""mistakenly"" gelded. He re-entered training in 2001 and joined the stable of Neil Drysdale in California. He raced twice at Santa Anita Park, finishing second in a claiming race in February and fourth in a similar event in March.

In 2002 Mus-If moved to the training stable of Michael Pino and began his campaign in claiming races at Fair Grounds Race Course. After finishing fourth and third on his first two starts he recorded his first success for three and a half years whe taking a claimer on 11 March. After winning a similar event at Keeneland Racecourse in April he was stepped up in class to contest the Henry S. Clark Stakes over one mile at Pimlico Race Course on 4 May. Starting favourite against ten opponents he took the lead in the stretch and won by five lengths under a ""hand ride"" from his trainer's brother Mario Pino. Three weeks later at the same track, Mus-If extended his winning sequence to four in the C. Edmund O'Brien Stakes. With Mario Pino again in the saddle he started at long odds-on and came home two lengths clear of Cynics Beware after taking the lead on the home turn. His victory was only confirmed after a lengthy inquiry by the racecourse stewards into possible interference caused by Mus-If to one of his rivals on the far turn. The gelding's winning streak came to an end in June when he was beaten into second place by Del Mar Show in the Grade III New Hampshire Sweepstakes Handicap at Rockingham Park.

In the late summer and autumn of 2002 Mus-If was campaigned at Delaware Park Racetrack where he finished sixth in the Susex Handicap and third in the Leader of the Band Stakes before winning a claiming race on 6 October. On his last two starts he finihed second in a claiming race at Churchill Downs in November and seventh in a similar event at Fair Grounds on 8 December.",Mus_If,84
"The Army of a Dream

The Army of a Dream is a speculative fiction short story written by Rudyard Kipling, published in the Morning Post in June 1904. It models an alternate way of organizing the military, along lines of responsibility and competence instead of heredity and privilege, as he had seen that the British Military was at that time.

Using indirect exposition, Kipling conveys to the reader that the narrator is experiencing the story as a dream. The story itself involves a military man taking the narrator around and showing off his military unit, the ""Tynesiders"". It is revealed that in their society, military service is voluntary, but almost universal, because only those who have served may vote, along with a number of other incentives. Unlike military forces common through much of history, those of the story are not authoritarian or what one might otherwise call ""militaristic"", but are a sort of citizen militia composed of competent men focused on dealing with any threat to their community and nation.

Rudyard Kipling was, in general, a major influence on one of the 20th century's most influential writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In his seminal work Starship Troopers, Heinlein models a similar society, where one is not a citizen unless one becomes a veteran of government service. While this does not have to be in combat forces but is actually more like being a civil servant, that novel follows characters in the mobile infantry, and is in fact the origin of the mech trope that has pervaded science fiction since. Also foreshadowed is Heinlein's fondness for the competent hero, a character who — though usually bearing normal human flaws — is rugged and self-responsible, able to do most things at least on a fundamental level and functioning with a high level of confidence and self-actualization.",The_Army_of_a_Dream,85

"Elmer S. Rigdon

Elmer S. Rigdon (June 16, 1868-December 13, 1922) was a member of the California State Senate from Cambria, California. He was the key proponent for building the Carmel-San Simeon Highway along the Big Sur coast. He was a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways and during World War I promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast. He persuaded the legislature to approve the project. In 1919, the legislature approved submission of a bond measure to voters. 

He was the son of Rufus Rigdon and Indiana Scott Rigdon. His parents homesteaded in Cambria during the 1860s. Elmer Rigdon became a rancher and timber harvester. He also owned a brickyard in Cambria and the Bank Mine on San Simeon Creek. He extracted quicksilver from the mine from 1903 to 1906, when he sold his interest. He was elected to the California state assembly in 1914 and to the state senate in 1916.

Dr. John L. D. Roberts, who founded Seaside, California, had a strong interest in building a road along the California central coast. In 1897, he walked the entire stretch of rocky coast from from Monterey to San Luis Obispo in five days and mapped out the course of the future road. He photographed the land and became the first surveyor of the route. In 1915, he presented the results of his survey and photographic work to a joint session of the California legislature. Roberts initially promoted the coastal highway to allow access to a region of spectacular beauty, but failed to obtain funding. Rigdon embraced the necessity of building the road. As a member of the California Senate Committee on Roads and Highways during World War I, he promoted the military necessity of defending California's coast and persuaded the legislature to support the project. The $1.5 million bond issue was approved by voters, but construction was delayed by World War I. Federal funds were appropriated and in 1921 voters approved additional state funds.

Rigdon died in office before the highway was completed. At the dedication of the highway on On June 27, 1937, his wife dedicated a silver fir to her husband's memory. A small park and drinking fountain in a turnout between Vicente Creek Bridge and Big Creek Bridge, north of Lucia. was dedicated as the Elmer Rigdon Memorial Drinking Fountain.",Elmer_S__Rigdon,96

"Cuisine of Ceredigion

The coast of Ceredigion is made up of a long coastal plain that contains high cliffs, coves, large bays and estuaries. The coastal plain gets narrower towards the more mountainous north of the county and is cut by the wide estuaries of the Teifi and the Dyfi. The broad and fertile Teifi valley is ideal for dairy farming and mixed farming. Heavy rainfall washes the minerals out of the soil and results in the mountainous areas of the county having relatively poorer, acidic soils. The plough line can be as low as 700 feet, which restricts cultivation. 

The sea around Ceredigion has traditionally been rich in fish and for many centuries great shoals of herring would be caught in Cardigan Bay. The fish would be landed and sold at all the Ceredigion ports, including Aberaeron, Aberporth and Aberystwyth. At Aberystwyth the volume of herring landed increased significantly after the harbour was enlarged during the eighteenth century. Here, the fish were salted between September and November and then packed in barrels for transport by train to England. Herring was also an important food source for local people and the fish were salted in the autumn for winter use. 

In South Wales herring are known as Ysgadenyn (or Sgadan for short); in North Wales they are known as Pennog. At Aberporth herrings were sold to the following:
<poem>
Sgadan Aberporth, 
Dau fola ac un corff, 
Sgadan Aberporth, 
Dau enaid mewn un corff 
Aberporth herrings, 
two bellies in one body. 
Aberporth herrings, 
two souls in one body

</poem>
Swper Scadan, or Supper Herrings, is a traditional baked dish from the area and contains six to eight herrings which have been cleaned, scaled and filleted. A seasoning of mustard, salt and ground black pepper is spread on the inside of each herring fillet and the fillets are then rolled and laid on top of layers of thin potato slices, onions and apples, which form a base. The whole dish is topped off with more sliced potatoes, additional seasoning and a dessert spoon of sage. Boiling water is added and then the dish is baked in foil which is removed, when nearly ready, in order to brown the potatoes. Historically, this dish is considered to be an interesting recipe because it reflects the simplicity of the traditional Welsh kitchen prior to the introduction of the frying pan. At this time boiling, roasting and stewing were the most common methods of food preparation and kitchen utensils included the griddle, the tripod (which was used for roasting), the bakestone and a great iron pot which would be suspended over a fire. Salted herrings would also be roasted on the tripod, as an alternative to baking. 
Mackerel (Macrell) are also plentiful in Cardigan Bay. They are in season from late June to early September and are considered to have an excellent flavour when fresh. Bobby Freeman commented that this fish is at its best when ""the sea-green colours are very brilliant and beautiful, and the eyes are bright"". In Ceredigion, Mackerel was usually fried in vegetable oil or olive oil. The olive oil used to be imported into the Ceredigion ports that used to trade with the Mediterranean. It is reported that in the 1880s the fishermen of Aberaeron and New Quay once caught over one million mackerel over two nights. The fish were sold for a farthing each and what remained unsold from the mammoth catch was used on the fields as fertilizer. 
Monkfish is commonly caught in Cardigan Bay and Colin Pressdee comments that this fish is particularly suitable for kebabs due to the solid texture of the flesh, which is not grainy or flaky. He comments that the large tail can also be roasted French-style, like a leg of lamb and explains that this gives it the French name of 'gigot de mer'. He notes that in Ceredigion, some restaurants cook the fish in this way and accompany it with a red wine sauce.
Teifi Fish Bake is a traditional local fish dish made from fillets of cod and smoked haddock which are skinned, cubed and covered in a parsley sauce. Diced potato and Teifi cheese are added before the dish is baked and garnished with fresh parsley. [Welsh Calendar Cookbook, P 12]

Shellfish gathered from the shore once formed an important source of food for Ceredigion families. One traditional dish included scrambled eggs to which limpets (llygaid meheryn) and common periwinkles (gwichiaid) were added, these were then fried in bacon fat. Limpets would also be boiled with nettle tips, to help tenderise them, before being fried in oatmeal. S Minwel Tibbot, in her book 'Welsh Fare', has a recipe for Limpet Pie (tarten lygaid), which is a traditional dish from Aberporth. The limpets are boiled for half an hour and then bacon and leeks are added to a pastry-lined dish before being baked. Sand eels (llymriaid) were also eaten as part of the local diet and were usually fried in bacon fat. 
Lobster and shellfish are an important sea food industry for Ceredigion. However, by the 1980s the lobster stock of Cardigan Bay had become seriously depleted and this led to the Development Board for Rural Wales commencing a restocking programme. As a result, 19,000 baby lobsters were tagged and released off Aberystwyth between 1984 and 1988. 
Although fishing has been a traditional activity in Ceredigion for generations, fish stocks became heavily depleted due to commercial fishing. Today the trade is mainly restricted to local, part-time fishing boats. Gilli Davies comments that this means fishmongers and restaurants in places like Aberaeron usually serve fresh fish which may have been caught the same day, compared to deep sea fishing where the catch may spend up to two weeks at sea, before being transferred to market and consumed. 

The traditional importance of sea food to the local economy is now celebrated with the Cardigan Bay Seafood Festival. This seafood festival is held each July at Aberaeron harbour. Aberaeron also hosts an annual Mackerel festival, in late August and early September, in order to celebrate the traditional importance of this fish to the economy of the town. 

Freshwater fish were also a traditional and important part of the Ceredigion diet. The River Teifi is noted for its salmon and sewin. The source of the river is located near Tregaron. The river then runs through a valley that was once ""thick with mansions and former great houses"" before entering the sea at Cardigan. It is said that during the nineteenth century salmon was so plentiful that servants begged not to be fed it more than three times a week. As a result, 'Teifi salmon sauce' is found in almost every collection of Welsh recipes from the kitchens of the Welsh country houses. Freeman notes that Welsh eighteenth century recipes tend to use a large quantity of butter, which reflects the fashion in most country house cooking of this period. Lady Llanover, in her book 'First Principles of Good Cookery', gives detailed instructions for crimping fresh-caught salmon in order to 'set' the flesh before the curd (which is the white substance between the flakes of orange flesh) melts and makes the fish oily. Fennel, which grows wild in Ceredigion, was often used in sauces for fish, especially salmon and mackerel. 
Gerald of Wales commented on the spectacular sight of salmon leaping at the waterfalls at Cenarth while Bobby Freeman recalls that when she ran a hotel in Pembrokeshire in the 1960s, salmon from the river Teifi would be dropped off by bus outside the hotel, with the bus conductor carrying them in boxes to the kitchen. The fish had been packed in cool, fresh bracken with six or seven big fish to a box. 

Salmon is in season in Wales from February to October, but the main runs of fish tend to be from June to September. When in the river salmon use their energy to produce roe ready for spawning and so the flesh begins to deteriorate quickly. For this reason Pressdee notes that gravid fish, which tend to be darker and thinner, should be avoided and left in the river to spawn. He also notes that wild salmon are considered to have a more solid and defined texture and a flavour than farmed salmon and comments that this reflects their diet of shellfish, while farmed salmon, although more readily available, tends to have less muscular flesh and a more buttery taste. 
Trout are also plentiful in the rivers of Ceredigion and are farmed commercially at Rhydlewis Trout Farm where the trout are raised in pools fed by the rivers Teifi and Ceri and smoked in wooden chambers. 

The flavour of lamb from Welsh Mountain Sheep is influenced by geography. Ceredigion's coastal cliffs are subject to westerly winds which cover the cliffs in salt spray. The spray is caught by goose grass on which the lambs graze and this influences the flavour of the meat. Along estuaries and salt marshes, such as the Dyfi Estuary Mudflats, wild spearmint, samphire and sea beet give the meat a rich flavour, with saline nuances while lamb from upland areas, like Cader Idris, feed off mauve flowering heather (calluna) in summer which gives the meat a more aromatic flavour. 
The flavour of Welsh lamb is also influenced by the seasons. Spring lamb appears on sale from May each year and is sweet and mild-flavoured. Pressdee notes that this makes it ideal for light spring casseroles, particularly if warmth of flavour is required. Autumn lamb, however, acquires a stronger, gamey flavour but can be richer in flavour and can be enhanced by the addition of fresh, wild field mushrooms. 
Although Welsh Mountain Sheep are smaller than other British sheep breeds, it is considered to have a sweeter flavour and to have more meat nearer the bone. Generally, the shoulder of Welsh lamb is more succulent, and has a higher fat content, than the leg. However, due to the difficulty of carving it, shops tend to sell shoulder of lamb already boned and rolled. 
Up until the nineteenth century, mutton was a popular dish in Wales. However, due to changes in farming practices and food preferences, it is no longer part of the staple diet. However, it can still be found in Victorian recipe books, where the salting, or 'powdering', of mutton and the preparation of 'Welsh Mutton Hams' was a regular item of daily fare. Mutton was commonly found in Ceredigion restaurants catering for the Victorian tourist trade. 

Pigs have been an important part of the Ceredigion diet since Medieval times and are recorded in the Laws of Hywel Dda. Up until the middle of the twentieth century every cottage would keep a pig in the back yard. As a result, Welsh cookery books usually include several recipes which Freeman classifies as being based on the ""bacon-plus-potatoes theme"". The killing of the family pig would be a community event and village households would co-ordinate pig killing in order to avoid an over-supply of pork in the village. When a pig was killed, all the parts of the animal which couldn't be salted or eaten would be given to neighbours with each pig providing a stock of faggots, sausages, puddings, brawn and haslet. Haslet and faggots are still popular dishes in Wales and can usually be bought from the local market. Haslet is often called aislet or islet in Wales. 
Pressdee comments that traditional butchers can be found in Ceredigion that produce dry-salted Welsh bacon and gammon from locally produced pork. The meat is considered to be generally of good value and widely available. He notes that the least expensive cut of pork is 'cig moch', or belly pork. Each farmhouse would traditionally cure its own bacon and the crackling from the belly, if cooked until crisp, was considered to be the most succulent part of a joint. 

The traditional cattle breed in wales is the Welsh Black cattle, which are relatively small but powerful animals. They forage for a wide variety of foods and this gives the meat a good flavour. At Llanerchaeron, the National Trust has a working farm which includes Welsh black cattle, together with other species of farm animals where they attempt to demonstrate the relationship between a country house, its service courtyard and the home farm and where visitors can see activities from a full year's farming calendar

Many local farms are family run, such as Golwg y Môr, and regularly supply local restaurants and shops, with cattle grazing on the coastal grass which produces tender and well flavoured meat.

Goat also remained a staple in Wales for much longer than in England. This is because goats were more suitable to the rugged Welsh terrain. Goat hams were often known in Wales as 'hung venison'. Although no longer popular, the antiquarian Thomas Pennant writes that in Wales 'hung venison' was a source of cheap and plentiful food during the winter months. 

In Ceredigion, the estates that once formed part of notable Welsh country houses, such as the Trawsgoed Estate, near Aberystwyth, now offer wild shooting for a variety of game (hunting). The Trawsgoed Estate covers over 5,000 acres of marshes and wetland around Tregaron Bog (Cors Caron). Here game includes pheasant, snipe, mallard, Eurasian teal, widgeon and hares. The Monachty Shoot is a long established shoot on a 1500 acre estate near Aberaeron which includes pheasant and duck. Cefngwyn Hall, south of Aberystwyth offers semi-wild duck shooting with 25 pools in 400 acres

Pheasant is commercially reared and then released into the wild where it spends one or two seasons feeding on grain, berries, worms, grubs and roots. This diet can lead to the flesh acquiring a deep mellow flavour which is improved if it is hung for several days in a cool, airy place. Pressdee recommends eating pheasant with a very rich old Burgundy wine or Rhone wine and believes that the flavour of a semi-wild bird is better than the flavour of one reared and fed on commercial feed. 

In Wales several venison farms have free-range deer and cull their animals when young and tender. Venison can be treated like beef, lamb or pork and many recipes include venison which has a rich flavour. 
Rabbits are plentiful in Wales, especially along undisturbed open land and along the shoreline. The meat is tender and delicate and can be used in a variety of ways, including casseroles. 

Most rural families traditionally kept geese or ducks. Geese would feed on the fields after the harvest had been gathered in order to help fatten them quickly. Welsh hill-farms used goose feathers for bedding, while large goose feathers would be used in the kitchen for sweeping the hearth. Smaller wing feathers would be used for brushing flour or oatmeal while baking. Goose meat was also used in cawl and Michaelmas Goose, or Gwydd Mihangel, is a recipe where the goose is boiled in water with a bowlful of chopped onions, salt and pepper and thickened with oatmeal. The thick fatty broth was popular during cold weather. Goose cawl also formed part of the feast given by a farmer to his tenants when they paid their rents. 
The potato has been a staple vegetable in Wales since its introduction and a number of interesting recipes have developed as a result. Potato Harvest Pudding (Poten Ben Fedi), for example, is a traditional Sunday supper dish made during late September and October, once the potato harvest had been collected and stored Another traditional dish is Roast Potatoes and Bacon (Tatws Rhost a Bacwm), which would be cooked in the pot oven (or ffwrn fach) over the fire until cooked. The combination of potatoes with bacon is a traditional one in Welsh cuisine, where the relative blandness of the potato is counter-balanced by the saltiness and fat of the bacon. If potato was not available, cabbage would take the place of potatoes to give a Bacon and Cabbage dish (Cig Moch a Chabaits), with the cabbage being cooked in the liquor of the bacon or a boiling ham. 
Although leeks are closely connected with Wales, Freeman notes that there are few recipes specifically made for them. At one time they were the only member of the onion family that grew throughout Wales and thus merited a mention in the Laws of Hywel Dda, together with the cabbage. One notable dish is Pastai Cennin (Leek pasty) which combines leeks with a shortcrust pastry.
Cawl is a soup or broth that was an important dish throughout Wales and would traditionally be eaten with a special cawl-spoon. This was made of wood to avoid burning the mouth on the hot broth. Traditionally, the broth of the cawl would be drunk first and the meat and vegetables eaten second. This is similar to the French dish pot au feu, which cawl closely resembles. These days cawl is eaten all at once, although the use of a hand-carved wooden cawl spoon and a wooden bowl may be less common than before. Traditionally, cawl is accompanied by nothing more than a hunk of wholemeal bread and a chunk of cheese 
There is no standard cawl recipe, but in New Quay it was traditionally made on the beach on the first day of August as a special feast for the sailors of the village. One woman would oversee the making of the cawl in a large cauldron, while each family would contribute its portion of the ingredients - either a piece of beef or fresh garden vegetables. Because of the variety of vegetables available during the summer, cawl was considered to be at its best during this time of year and was known as Cawl Awst.
Tregaron has its own cawl recipe, known as Tregaron Broth (Cawl Mamgu Tregaron). This is made from meat and vegetables boiled in water, except for the leeks, which are added later. The vegetables usually include parsnip, potatoes, carrots, swede, and white cabbage while the meat includes bacon and shin beef (beef shank). The ingredients are boiled together with oatmeal to thicken and left simmering for as long as required. The leek is added 10 minutes before serving and the cawl is left to boil. Cawl is a key part of traditional Welsh cuisine and Bobby Freeman noted that it forms ""an unspoken part of life"" in Wales.

Ceredigion is noted for dairy produce which is due to the quality of its pasture. In the past, milk would be sent daily to London to ""quench the capital's thirst"". As a result, Ceredigion also has an important dairy industry and, in addition to milk, is noted for its cheese and yoghurt. 

Gilli Davies notes that, in Wales, the system of transhumance meant that cheese production remained a farmhouse activity for longer than elsewhere in Britain. During the summer, butter and cheese making would form part of the economy of the hafod, the summer dwelling-place of the Welsh farmer (see Agriculture in Wales). The hafod would be located up in the hills, where the livestock would make the best of the summer grazing. However, the acid soils of the uplands (highland) mean that hard cheeses are less easy to produce and traditionally the drovers, who would take the sheep on foot to market in England, would often barter sheep for a hard cheese, usually Cheddar cheese, in order to make their 'caws pobi' or welsh rabbit.
During the twentieth century there was a renaissance in cheese making in Ceredigion. Ty'n Grug is a farm-based cheese producer and is considered to be the 'uncle' of organic cheeses in Wales. It makes cheese from cow, goat and ewe milk and varieties include Teifi, Penbryn and Felin Gernos (from cows' milk), Merlin (from goats' milk) and Acorn (from ewes' milk). The proprietor, Dougall Campbell, was born in Sydney and moved to Ceredigion in 1976. He became a pioneering figure in the world of Welsh cheese production and is considered to have led the ""renaissance in farmhouse cheese-making"". By 1984 the few organic dairy farms in Ceredigion sold their milk to the Milk Marketing Board but without any premium for their organic produce. Campbell established Welsh Organic Foods to support organic milk producers, capitalising on the organic provenance of the milk and turning it into the first organic-cheese making company in Britain. He also helped educate the public on the nature and benefits of organic cheese. The Soil Association has since established the Dougal Campbell Memorial Fund in his honour while The Specialist Cheesemakers Association offers a bursary, known as the Dougal Campbell Cheese Award, for aspiring cheese makers. (Independent obituary) 

Tyn-y-Llwyn is farm-based cheese producer located at Pontrhydygroes. The farm produces a firm Cheddar-type cheese and has been in production since 1986. Flocks of Anglo-Nubian goat, the Alpine goat and Saanen goat breeds provide milk for the cheese. 

Little Acorn Products was established in 1985 at a time when cheese made from ewes milk was a rarity. The business was started from the kitchen table of Karen and Don Ross, who started by making one cheese a day and recorded the production process in detail. Their ewes' milk cheese resembles an old fashioned Wensleydale. In addition, they make cheeses from cows milk, including a variety called Monks of Strata Florida, named after a famous local monastery. 

Penbryn Organic Farmhouse Cheese is made by Paul Knifton and Andrea Degen, who previously made Gouda cheese in Ireland and Holland respectively. The cheese moulds are filled with curd and wrapped individually by hand and stored for 8-10 months to enhance the flavour to give a traditional taste. Varieties include a Penbryn Mature cheese. Gilli Davies comments that they ""produce some of the best cheese produced in Wales today"". Teifi Farmhouse Cheese is made at Ffostrasol, Llandysul and is considered to be one of the finest farmhouse cheeses made in Wales. 

Rachel's Organic was established by Rachel Rowland at Brynllys Farm; a 254 acre organic farm in Dolybont, near Borth, that has been owned by four generations of the same family. In 1982, a snow storm prevented access to the farm so, in order not to waste the farm's milk, they made butter for local consumption. Production of butter, yoghurt and cheese soon followed. Rachel's grandmother was a dairy instructor at UCW, Aberystwyth, and was responsible for developing organic methods using scientific principles. 

Organic wheat is still stone-ground in small flour mills across Wales. The slow grinding of the flour retains the wheat germ in its entirety while the warm, but not hot, friction between the mill stones gently releases the wheat oil and thus retains all the nutrients. In Ceredigion, Felin Ganol, at Llanrhystud, is an example of a restored flour mill that retains its original machinery. It is the only working water-powered mill in Ceredigion and was visited by the Prince of Wales in 2012. 

Bread and cakes were made for daily use and also for special occasions, which usually revolved around the religious or agricultural calendar. Freeman notes that cakes come from the later tradition in Welsh cookery, when the bakestone was replaced by the oven. Sheep shearing remains one of the major social occasions in Welsh rural life and during this period farmers help each other with the rounding-up of the sheep and the shearing of the wool. At this time the host farm will spend days beforehand making pies, cakes and baked meats. Cacen Gneifo, or Shearing Cake, is a traditional cake made at this time, which is flavoured with caraway seeds. The Threshing Cake, or Cacen Ddyrnu, is a traditional cake made at threshing time and uses buttermilk and bacon fat, which are always available on Welsh farms. Teisen Carawe, or Seed Cake, is another cake using caraway seeds. It is one of the oldest of the Welsh egg-raised cakes and is traditionally associated with chapel and Sunday tea in the parlour. An old Ceredigion recipe is Christmas Cake, or Teisen Ddu Nadolig, which typically includes some home brewed ale. 

Commercial bakeries developed in urban areas during the nineteenth and early twentieth century to satisfy the need of urban dwellers to bake their own bread. They would bring their home-prepared dough to the bakehouse in baking tins and would pay the baker for baking it. The reason for this is that town houses were fitted with iron ovens attached to kitchen ranges which were not regarded as 'good bakers of bread'. Derwen Bakehouse was one of three such bakehouses in Aberystwyth. It served the community of Aberystwyth from around 1900 to 1924 and was re-erected in the National Museum of History during the mid-1980s. It is a functional bakery that allows visitors to the Museum to see bakers at work using traditional wooden appliances, mixing dough and using the large brick oven in the traditional way.

Pancakes, which are called poncagen (poncagau) or pancosen (pancos) in Ceredigion, are considered to be as traditional in Wales as cawl. Because they could be quickly made on the bakestone over the fire and would often be made for unexpected visitors, as a birthday treat or eaten at high tea. Pancakes still remain popular and are considered best made with buttermilk and bicarbonate of soda, rather than ordinary milk. Most recipe books from Welsh country houses include pancake recipes that use cream, which would be considered a special luxury.

Waffles are a more recent addition to Ceredigion cuisine, with local production commencing in the 1980s. Tregroes Waffles is run by Kees Huysmans and Ans Brouwer who arrived in Ceredigion in 1981 from Holland. They started with a simple waffle iron offering their first waffles at a Guy Fawkes party at Henllan in 1984 and have since moved to larger premises in Llandysul. 

Trifle and rice pudding remain very popular in west Wales, with Freeman commenting that trifle is the ""more or less obligatory 'finale' to a special occasion feast"". In the case of rice pudding, this is expected to be rich and creamy.

Fruit growing tends to be for household use, with each farm having its own apple, plum or damson tree. However, due to the acid soil in upland areas soft fruit is a rarity, although it may be gown on a commercial basis where the soil is less acid. Pen Caled is a traditional apple variety from Ceredigion which is a good variety for cider production. It has a full, sharp taste and is low in tannin. It can also be used as a late season cooking apple. Pren Glas is an apple variety from the St Dogmaels area. It is an early season eating apple. Both apples are available from commercial growers. Like elsewhere in the country Welsh apples and fruit varieties may await rediscovery and a full assessment of traditional Welsh horticultural biodiversity remains to be undertaken.

Wild fruit is also collected, including blackberry (mwyar), whinberry (llus), wild raspberry (afan) and wild cranberry, which can be found growing in the boggier uplands of Ceredigion. Gooseberry and rhubarb are also commonly grown in gardens. 
Fruit tarts, including turnover tarts, were traditionally made on the bakestone, without a plate or dish and sugar was only added, after the fruit was cooked. This was done by lifting off the pastry lid and then working it into the fruit. Making a tart on the bakestone required skill and the use of a special wooden slice. 

Ceredigion farming traditions go back generations but the influence of alternative lifestyles has added new ideas and philosophies to traditional ways of life and thus enriched the local community. This means that, in addition to traditional Welsh staples, such as butter and bacon, new foods such as pulses, beans and soya milk have supplemented the diet. In addition, there has been a move away from artificially fertilized farm land to organic pasture, together with a growth in horticulture and an increase in the production of high quality produce. 
Outlets that sell organic produce include Rhydyfelin Stores at Rhydfelin, which is a village shop and community hub , The Tree House in Pier Street, Aberystwyth which is a shop and restaurant. , The Organic Fresh Food Company which is a shop and bakery near Lampeter, suppliers that are certified by the Soil Association include Organic Farm Foods , Nantgwynfaen Organic Farm Shop at Croeslan, Llandysul and Glebelands Market Garden at St Dogmaels. 

Dà Mhìle is an independent whiskey distillery established in 2012 with help from the Springbank Distillery. It is based at Glynhynod Farm and is reputed to be the first organic, farmhouse distillery in the UK. The distillery produces organic whiskey and offers guided tours by arrangement. It also produces an organic orange liqueur called Dà Mhile Orange 33. 
Freeman notes that home-brewed beer is ""a legend"" in rural Wales, with family recipes being jealously guarded. One farm that now produces beer commercially is Panteg Farm, at Maen-y-groes where Penlon Cottage Brewery offer beer tastings and events. They produce ten types of ales, lagers and stouts using traditional methods and vegetarian recipes.

Celtic Country Wines, is located at Henllan, Llandysul and produces fruit wines, liqueurs and country preserves. The winery accepts visitors and has a gift shop.

Traditionally, ginger beer has always been popular as a non-alcoholic alternative to ordinary beer. There are two kinds of Welsh ginger beer, one uses a gingered herb to make 'small' beer and the other uses root ginger.
Tŷ Nant is a 350 year old farm near Bethania, Ceredigion. The farm has bottled spring water since 1986. The Tŷ Nant brand was established in 1989 and is recognised by its distinctive cobalt blue, glass bottles which won a British Glass Federation design award and were the first bottles to use dark blue glass since Phillip's Milk of Magnesia. Llanllyr is a bottled water which has been drawn since 1180 at an organic farm in Talsarn, and is available throughout Wales.",Cuisine_of_Ceredigion,101
"Sandige

Sandige () or vadam is a fried snack popular in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. It is also served as an accompaniment with meals.

Sandige is prepared by making a gruel of the main ingredient and spiced with asafoetida, chili paste and salt. The gruel is poured on a plastic sheet or a big piece of cloth and dried under the sun for a couple of days. To make aralu sandige and avalakki sandige, the main ingredients are added to the gruel and made into balls and sun-dried. Peni and avalakki sandige are made using chakli molds and extruders.

"Pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition

The Pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC, was extended from Chou’s Pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC . Both PseAAC and PseKNC are of vector descriptor, but the former represents protein or peptide sequences while the latter represents DNA or RNA sequences. 

To avoid completely losing the sequence-order information for protein and peptide sequences, the pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC was proposed by Kuo-Chen Chou. But how about for DNA and RNA sequences? To address this problem, the pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition or PseKNC was proposed. For the convenience scientific community, a freely available web server, called PseKNC and an open source package, called PseKNC-General were developed in 2013 and 2014, which could convert large-scale sequence datasets to pseudo nucleotide compositions with numerous choices of physicochemical property combinations. PseKNC-General can generate several modes of pseudo nucleotide compositions, including conventional k-tuple nucleotide compositions, Moreau–Broto autocorrelation coefficient, Moran autocorrelation coefficient,Geary autocorrelation coefficient, Type I PseKNC and Type II PseKNC. 

Like PseAAC in computational proteomics and proteome analysis, PseKNC has also been increasingly used in computational genomics and performing various genome analyses.",Pseudo_K_tuple_nucleotide_composition,108

The men's slalom competition of the PyeongChang 2018 Olympics will be held on 22 February 2018 at the Yongpyong Alpine Centre at the Alpensia Sports Park in PyeongChang.

A total of up to 320 alpine skiers qualified across all eleven events. Athletes qualified for this event by having met the A qualification standard, which meant having 140 or less FIS Points and being ranked in the top 500 in the Olympic FIS points list or meeting the B standard, which meant 140 or less FIS points. Countries not meeting the A standard were allowed to enter a maximum of one B standard athlete per gender. The Points list takes into average the best results of athletes per discipline during the qualification period (July 1, 2016 to January 21, 2018). Countries received additional quotas by having athletes ranked in the top 30 of the 2017–18 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup (two per gender maximum, overall across all events). After the distribution of B standard quotas (to nations competing only in the slalom and giant slalom events), the remaining quotas were distributed using the Olympic FIS Points list, with each athlete only counting once for qualification purposes. A country could only enter a maximum of four athletes for the event.

"Glan-Blies Way

The Glan-Blies Way () is a long distance cycle route and hiking trail that is 130 kilometres long. It begins in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate at Staudernheim on the River Nahe, follows the course of the Glan, crosses the state of Saarland along the Blies and finishes in Lorraine. 

The way begins on the Nahe Cycleway. Running past Disibodenberg Abbey and then making its way via Odernheim am Glan and Meisenheim it reaches the Kusel Musikantenland. In the Veldenz town of Lauterecken there is a railway connexion and the option to switch onto the Lauter Valley Cycleway to Kaiserslautern. A few kilometres further on, the trail passes Offenbach-Hundheim and the old Benedictine Provost Church of St. Mary. It then continues initially in a southwesterly direction, then swings south to Altenglan. At Altenglan, a junction with the Fritz-Wunderlich Way runs through Kusel on an old railway trackbed to Freisen. Between Altenglan and Staudernheim, there is a separate draisine route that runs through the Glan valley. The cycleway continues for two kilometres alongside the federal highway.
Between Glan-Münchweiler and Niedermohr the Barbarossa Cycleway branches off, running through North Palatinate to Worms. From Glan-Münchweiler the route follows the old trackbed of the Glan Valley Railway via Nanzdietschweiler, with its old washing facility and the preserved mill from 1884, through the Elschbach Tunnel. It continues past the lake of Ohmbachsee to Schönenberg-Kübelberg, where it passes the protected railway station. Next, the way passes Waldmohr with its bog mill and the Eichelscheiderhof. Here it leaves the route of the railway and follows cycle tracks to Homburg. 

After Beeden the way runs along the River Blies through the Bliesgau Biosphere Reserve. In Wörschweiler, a detour goes to the abbey ruins and the Schwarzenacker Roman Museum. On the next stage, the route reaches Blieskastel with its baroque ""Altstadt"". The route runs along the old embankment of the Blies Valley Railway. The last station on German soil is the Bliesbruck-Reinheim European Culture Park, with a Celtic prince's grave and settlement from the Roman era. Here the way crosses the Franco-German border and comes to an end after Saargemünd (French: ""Sarreguemines"") at the confluence of the Blies and the Saar. 

In Sarreguemines the Glan-Blies Way is joined from the north by the Saar Cycleway, which runs between Sarreguemines and Völklingen parallel to the Saarland Cycleway. To the south is a junction with the cycling path along the Saar Canal and thus to the French cycle network.

The bidirectional way is signposted throughout. The waymarks along the route give the distances and destinations as well as the logo of the way. The multicoloured logo depicts a beckoning cyclist and bears the inscription ""Glan-Blies-Weg"". The route runs predominantly on asphalt forest tracks, farm tracks and cycle paths.",Glan_Blies_Way,115

"Nairobi College

Nairobi College was a small radical left junior college in East Palo Alto, California for ethnic minority students in the late 1960s.

The College was part of a movement for ethnic minority groups in the United States to have dedicated academic programs to train themselves in the theory and practice of liberation, resistance, and revolution. These programs were referred to as ""Third world colleges"", which sought to practice the principles of self-determination and community empowerment while teaching left-radical ideology in rejection of the perceived bourgeois ideology and white control of mainstream academic institutions. Prominent advocates for this movement included graduate student Angela Davis and professors Herbert Marcuse of the University of California San Diego and Carlos Blanco of Thurgood Marshall College. Other colleges founded as part of this movement included Malcolm X Liberation University, Uhuru Sasa Shule, the Center for Black Education, and Thurgood Marshall College.

Nairobi College began classes in the fall of 1960 with initial funding of $100,000 donated by area residents and private foundations.. 20,000 books were donated by schools, individuals, and publishers, which were kept in two residential garages. Anyone at least 16 years of age was welcome to enroll at no cost. The first class had working-class 100 students, some of whom were high school dropouts. The all-volunteer faculty numbered about 40 and consisted of student and professors from nearby universities as well as community organizers.
Based out of a small private home in East Palo Alto, Nairobi College operated out of stores, church buildings, and homes throughout black, Latino, and Asian neighborhoods in the San Francisco Peninsula.
The college leadership hoped that spreading classes out in these existing structures would integrate it with the needs and reality of their surrounding community, calling it a ""college without walls"" in contrast to the perceived ""ivory tower"" of mainstream academia. It was a two-year college.

The students were primarily African American and Hispanic, although working-class white students were also included. Most of them worked full time and took classes in the evenings. All students were required to utilize their training to provide skilled volunteer work three hours per week in support of area social organizations, such as schools, community health centers, and legal aid.

Instructors included Ed Roberts, a disability rights activist, Tello Nkhereanye, a leftist from South Africa, Frank Omowale Satterwhite, a community organizer, Aaron Manganello, a Marxist minister of education for the Brown Berets, and Mary Hoover, a Stanford academic advocate for African-American English.

The Corral del Coliseo is an old corral de comedias (a Spanish theatre) of 16th century in Seville (Andalusia, Spain), near the Plaza de la Encarnación square, which was later converted into a corral of neighbors and is currently is used as a residential building.

It has been documented that in March of 1612, ""Claramonte"" directs the Corral del Coliseo in Seville, and promises to provide the Company with ""eight old or already premiered comedies for four hundred reales, and new or never seen, at a rate of 250 reales"". It is also known that in 1620, ""Ortiz y los Valencianos"" represented the work of ""Claramonte"" ""The Great King of the Deserts"" in the Corral del Coliseo. In this same year the Corral del Coliseo suffered a devastating fire.

A lawsuit in 1619 between the owner of the Corral del Coliseo and some authors of comedies also serves as a guide to understand the society of the time. The complaint was lodged by Francisco de Rivera, landlord of the Corral del Coliseo, on June 5, 1619, before Juan Muñoz de Escovar, """"of the Council and Accountant major of accounts of His Majesty, Judge of the Performance of this city of Seville"""", against Juan Acacio and Diego de Vallejo (both authors of comedies), because they decided to represent the autos sacramentales of Corpus Christi in the ""Corral de doña Elvira"". With this, they contravened a previous resolution, of May 25, of the same judge in which he arranged to be represented in the Corral del Coliseo. For what said the landlord of the Corral """"...because such contempt should not be given, to your mercy I beg and beg, command to arrest the said authors of comedies, which are Juan Acacio and Diego de Vallejo, and remove the posters that are placed, executing them for the penalties in which they have incurred and in the damages that the treasury of this city for the said cause have been followed and continue, and I ask for justice. / So for proof of the above, I make a demonstration of one of the posters that the aforementioned have posted by the corners and the auto for your mercy provided and notifications, and I ask for justice..."""". They serve these writings to revive the society of the time and understand the theater of the Spanish golden age.

"Warakamai

The Warakamai, now more frequently known as the Warrgamay, are an indigenous Australian people of the state of Queensland.

Their language, Warrgamay, is now extinct. It was a variety of Dyirbalic, and appears to be composed of three distinct dialects:""Wargamaygan"" spoken around the lower reaches of the Herbert River; ""Biyay"" spoken at the mouth of the Herbert, in the area of Halifax and Bemerside; and ""Hinchinbrook Biyay,"" spoken around the coastal area south of Cardwell and offshore on Hinchinbrook Island.

The Warakamai were the indigenous people of Halifax Bay, and held in Norman Tindale's calculations, approximately of tribal domains. An early resident, James Cassady, specified that they had 50 miles of shortline extending into the hinterland approximately 15 miles. Their northern neighbours were the Girramay, while to their south lay the Wulgurukaba.

The Warakamai were divided into several hordes:

The intermarriage of groups has been classified as follows:

Circumcision as an initiatory rite was unknown among the Warakamai. They did practice tooth avulsion, ritual scarification and piercing of the septum to wear nose bones. Polygamy was common, and widows were married to their deceased husband's brother.

The area of Halifax Bay first began to be settled by white colonialists in 1865. At that time the numbers of Warakami were estimated to amount to roughly 500 people. Within 15 years, they had declined by 300, a mere 40 of the surviving 200 being men. The difference was due to their being relentlessly hunted and gunned down by mounted native troopers under white supervision, together with settlers, both of whom 'shot as many of the males of the tribe as possible.'",Warakamai,145
"Paul Sheard

Paul James Sheard (born November 25, 1954) is a US-based Australian economist. He was an academic economist based in Australia, Japan and the United States, specializing in the Japanese economy and the economics of firm organization, before moving into financial markets in 1995. He has held chief economist positions at Lehman Brothers, Nomura Securities, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, and S&P Global. Sheard was a member of the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on the International Monetary System (2010-2012), and is a member of the Bretton Woods Committee. He attends and speaks regularly at conferences around the world, and his views on the global economy and economic policy are frequently cited in the international press. Sheard is currently Vice Chairman of S&P Global.

Sheard was Kiyoshi Kojima Postdoctoral Fellow at the Australia-Japan Research Centre, ANU, Lecturer in Economics, and later Associate Professor of Economics at Osaka University. He held visiting scholar positions at Osaka University, the Bank of Japan, and Stanford University, where he was also visiting assistant professor of economics.

In January 1995, Sheard became Japan Strategist for Baring Asset Management and later Head of Japan Equity Investments. In September 2000, he was appointed Chief Economist for Asia of Lehman Brothers and became Global Chief Economist of Lehman in April 2006. When Lehman failed in September 2008, after a stint at Barclays Capital, in November 2008 Sheard was appointed Global Chief Economist and Head of Economic Research at Nomura Securities, based in New York. In June 2012, he moved to Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services as Global Chief Economist and Head of Global Economics and Research and a member of the firm’s executive committee, later becoming Chief Economist and Executive Vice President of S&P Global, the parent firm.

Sheard served as a member of committees of the Japanese Government’s Economic Deliberation Council, in 1997-98 as an appointee of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and in 1998-99 as an appointee of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi. He served as a member of the oversight board of the Japanese Government’s Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, 2001-2006. From 2003 to 2010, Sheard served as a non-executive director of ORIX Corporation, a large Japanese financial services firm.

Sheard’s academic work analyzed the economic rationale of distinct features of Japanese corporate organization, including the role of multi-tier subcontracting networks in the auto sector ; the role of main banks and interlocking shareholdings in creating an internalized market for corporate control that supported the ""lifetime"" employment system; the informational and risk-sharing role of general trading companies (Sogo shosha) as financial intermediaries; and assessing the arguments that Japanese firms avoided short-termism. In the ""structural impediments"" debate of the early 1990s, Sheard argued that many of the features criticized as ""non-tariff barriers"" or as being anti-competitive were better understood in terms of how firms and markets in Japan were efficiently organized. He pointed out that the common practice of characterizing keiretsu or affiliated enterprise groups in Japan as ""horizontal groups"" was confusing because to many foreign observers ""horizontal"" connoted within-same-market whereas most of the relationships in question were ""vertical"" (between stages of production) or between-market in nature. 

As a markets economist in Tokyo, Sheard was active in the policy debate. He identified the failure of the government to aggressively recapitalize the banks after it issued a blanket guarantee of deposits in June 1995 and the aggregate demand management policy mix of ""timid"" monetary policy and stop-start fiscal policy, under macro deleveraging, as contributing to Japan’s falling into and remaining in deflation. 

After the Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession, Sheard argued that sustained, aggressive monetary and fiscal policy expansion was needed to restore lost aggregate demand in the developed economies. 

He has argued that quantitative easing, far from being inflationary ""money printing,"" is best viewed as a ""debt management operation of the consolidated government"" whereby the central bank retires government debt securities and refinances them into central bank money, and that, contrary to common parlance, banks cannot ""lend out"" their excess reserves. 

Invoking the metaphor of a ""Monetary Garden of Eden"", Sheard has argued that monetary and fiscal policies should be viewed as ""two sides of the same sovereign coin"" and much more closely coordinated and aligned. 

Sheard has argued that monetary union without fiscal union in the euro area is unsustainable, describing the architecture of the euro area at the time of the sovereign debt crisis as akin to putting countries, when hit by a sudden loss of aggregate demand, in a ""macroeconomic vice,"" and that a steady-state solution must involve ""either less monetary union or more fiscal union."" Sheard identifies the fundamental problem with the economic and political architecture of the European Union as being the ""selective sharing of sovereignty,"" viewing Brexit as being as much about the future of the EU as about the UK’s relationship with the EU.

Long a critic of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy communication and action, Sheard has been a strong supporter of the Bank’s April 2013 policy shift under Governor Haruhiko Kuroda, describing it as the monetary policy equivalent of a Copernican Revolution.

Sheard received a Bachelor of Arts (Honours in Japanese and Geography) from Monash University (1981) and a PhD in Japanese Economy (1986) and Master of Economics (1988) from the ANU.

Sheard’s 1981 undergraduate thesis was awarded the Institute of Australian Geographers’ Honours Thesis of the Year. His 1997 book in Japanese, Mein Banku Shihon Shugi no Kiki (The Crisis of Main Bank Capitalism), published by Toyo Keizai Shinposha, was awarded the 1998 Suntory Gakugei Prize in the Economics-Politics Section. In 2006, Sheard was recognized by Advance as one of 100 Leading Global Australians.",Paul_Sheard,146

"BC Energy Step Code

The BC Energy Step Code is a provincial regulation that local governments in British Columbia, Canada, may use, if they wish, to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction that goes above and beyond the requirements of the base building code. It is an example of a “stretch code,” or “reach code,” in that it is an appendix to a mandatory minimum energy code that allows communities to voluntarily adopt a uniform approach to achieving more ambitious levels of energy efficiency in new construction. 

The BC Energy Step Code consists of a series of specific measurable efficiency targets, and groups them into “steps” that represent increasing levels of energy-efficiency performance. By gradually adopting one or more steps, a local government can increase the building performance requirements in its community. The regulation is designed as a technical roadmap to help the province reach its target that all new buildings will attain a net zero energy ready level of performance by 2032. 

The Government of British Columbia enacted the BC Energy Step Code as regulation on April 6, 2017. It entered into legal force on December 15, 2017.

The BC Energy Step Code establishes a series of measurable energy-efficiency requirements that builders must meet in communities that reference it in their building and development bylaws. The regulation groups these performance targets into a series of “steps” of increasing energy efficiency. Step 1 simply requires confirmation that new buildings meet the existing energy-efficiency requirements of the existing ""BC Building Code"". Meanwhile, at the opposite end of the scale, Step 5 for homes represents a home that is net-zero energy ready. A Step 5 home is effectively the most energy-efficient home that can be built today, roughly equivalent to the rigorous Passive house standard.

The ""BC Building Code"" separates all buildings into two basic categories – Part 9 and Part 3, as follows: 


For Part 9 buildings, there are five steps of the BC Energy Step Code; Part 3 buildings have four steps, while commercial buildings have three. Each step represents a more stringent set of energy-efficiency requirements. As communities climb the steps, they gradually increase the level of energy efficiency in their new buildings. The BC Energy Step Code applies to new construction only.

For small buildings, Steps 1 to 3 (collectively, the ”Lower Steps”) can be achieved using construction techniques and products readily understood and available in today’s market; homes built to Steps 4 and 5 (the “Upper Steps”) are more ambitious and may require more training and incentives to achieve. 

The regulation is performance-based, not prescriptive, in that it does not specify the specific materials and strategies a builder must use. Instead, it sets measurable performance targets that the proposed building must meet.

To ensure that builders have the skills and capacity they need to cost-effectively produce higher performance buildings, until 2020, governments that wish to use the BC Energy Step Code may incentivize all steps, but may only require Lower Steps.

The BC Energy Step Code measures a building's energy performance via a variety of metrics. The Building Envelope Metrics and the Equipment and Systems Metrics are demonstrated through a whole-building energy modeling, while the Airtightness Metric is demonstrated through an on-site blower door test of the building before occupancy.







To meet the requirements of the BC Energy Step Code, builders will work with an energy advisor to check that their plans will meet the energy-performance requirements of a given step. An energy advisor uses software to analyze construction plans and determine the energy efficiency of a building. The builder then begins construction, paying special attention to the building envelope—the walls, windows, doors, and insulation. The energy advisor also tests a building once it is built to see how well it performs. 

To achieve the Lower Steps, building and design professionals and trades can rely on conventional building designs with careful air-sealing practices, and incrementally incorporate some key elements in the design, building envelope, and equipment and systems. Builders and designers will collaborate with the energy advisor to select the most cost effective way to meet the standard's requirements. These Lower Steps give builders new flexibility in how to achieve modest gains in efficiency through improved envelopes and/or upgraded systems.

To achieve the Upper Steps, builders and designers will need to adopt an integrated design approach to building design and may need to incorporate more substantial changes in building design, layout, framing techniques, system selection, and materials. These techniques and materials will be more costly and challenging without additional training and experience.

In September 2015, the province's Building Safety and Standards branch established an Energy Efficiency Working Group (EEWG) to review policies and regulations that apply to energy efficiency in BC, to seek stakeholder input and offer guidance on how to best implement an Energy Step Code to achieve consistent building energy performance beyond the BC Building Code. The consultations engaged with the building and development sectors, and the trades and professions that support them, as well as local governments, utilities, and other stakeholders, to identify a consistent approach to increasing energy-efficiency standards.

In August 2016, the group renamed itself the Stretch Code Implementation Working Group and published its final report and recommendations, including adoption of a Step Code into a voluntary provincial regulation.

In mid 2017, the province renamed the group the Energy Step Code Council, and mandated it ""to support local governments and industry towards smooth uptake of the BC Energy Step Code and help guide market transformation towards higher-performance buildings within B.C."" The Energy Step Code Council meets quarterly to support training and capacity building opportunities for local governments, industry, and other stakeholder, communicate what the BC Energy Step Code is and how it may be implemented across the province, and provide advice and clarification on technical aspects of the standard.

In September 2017, BC Housing, the province's housing authority, and the Energy Step Code Council published the ""BC Energy Step Code 2017 Metrics Research Study"" as a comprehensive exploration of the standard's energy, emissions and economic impacts. The research is based on data generated by builders from all across British Columbia, and bills itself as “one of the most extensive energy analyses of buildings in Canada.”

The researchers conclude that meeting the requirements of the Lower Steps of the BC Energy Step Code involve only very modest construction premiums. In most situations, builders can achieve the Lower Steps for less than a 2% construction cost premium above that of a home built to the requirements of the ""BC Building Code"". The construction cost premiums associated with meeting the requirements of Step 1 amounts to just a small fraction of a percent, the report states. In exchange, owners, occupants, and others would enjoy the benefits detailed in the ”Benefits of adoption” section below.

In an effort to illustrate how the BC Energy Step Code would impact construction costs in the “real world,” the study's authors produced a series of hypothetical scenarios for various building types in various cities.

The Metrics Research report offers an example of the anticipated capital construction cost premium for a hypothetical 730 square foot unit in a six-story apartment building in Surrey, British Columbia. Units in this hypothetical new building would sell for between CAD$270,000 and CAD$730,000.

For this building, the report says meeting the requirements of Step 1 would involve a construction cost premium of CAD$100 per unit above the cost of building to the standard modelling requirements of the ""BC Building Code"". Meeting the requirements of Step 2 would incur A 0.5 percent construction cost premium, about CAD$790 per unit. Meeting the requirements of Step 3 adds about CAD$970 to the per-unit build cost. Finally, the researchers found that building to the very high-performance levels of Step 4 may entail a per-unit construction cost premium of CAD$4,215.

The Metrics Research report also models an example of the anticipated capital construction cost premium for a hypothetical 1,720 square feet unit built into a six-unit row house project in Surrey, B.C. Units in this hypothetical new building would sell for between CAD$550,000 and CAD$800,000.

For this building, the researchers conclude that meeting the requirements of Step 1 would involve a construction cost premium of $560 per unit above the cost of building to the ""BC Building Code"". Meeting the requirements of Step 2 would incur a 0.4% construction cost premium, about CAD$1,250 per unit. Meeting the requirements of Step 3 adds about CAD$2,950 to the per-unit build cost. Finally, the report states that building to the highest performance levels may require non-conventional building practices; this would increase construction costs between $5,500 (Step 4) and $9,400 (Step 5) per unit, the study suggests.

Buildings built to higher energy efficiency standard have been shown to provide multiple co-benefits – to home and building owners and occupants, to industry, to the environment, and to the community. 

Owners and tenants often prefer high-performance buildings as they require less energy, reducing utility bills. Occupants also prefer them because they better manage:


The BC Energy Step Code provides industry with a clear sense of where the province is heading on energy efficiency, while giving builders a welcome level of consistency via standardized performance metrics.

If a given community’s new homes are likely to be heated with natural gas, the BC Energy Step Code will reduce the amount of that fuel they need to burn to stay comfortable. A well-insulated and well-sealed Step 3 home heated with natural gas will consume much less of the fuel when compared with one built to the minimum code requirements. This will result in fewer carbon emissions.

The global green-building market doubles every three years and the value of the green building materials market is expected to reach $234 billion by 2019. British Columbia is already a green building design and construction leader, boasting some of highest-performing buildings in North America. Almost 12,000 people work in green architecture and related construction services in BC, while close to 9,000 work in clean energy services. The BC Energy Step Code could open up new local economic development opportunities, and helps unlock a significant export opportunity. At a November 2017 conference, an assistant deputy minister with the Province of British Columbia’s Office of Housing and Construction Standards called the BC Energy Step Code ”a driver of the clean economy.”

The BC Energy Step Code is available to communities to all climate zones across the province for Part 9 buildings, and only to Climate Zone 4 (Lower Mainland and South Vancouver Island) for Part 3 buildings. Future iterations of the standard will increase coverage to all types and all areas.

All British Columbia local governments except the City of Vancouver may reference and enforce the BC Energy Step Code in their policies and bylaws. The City of Vancouver has its own building code, and its own high-performance buildings strategy, the Zero Emissions Building Plan.

On October 2, 2017, the City of North Vancouver became the first local government to reference the BC Energy Step Code in its building bylaws.. At a subsequent meeting, city council unanimously agreed to write a letter to the provincial governments requesting BC Energy Step Code standards for government buildings, hospitals, and schools.

As of the start of 2018, 15 of British Columbia's local governments have indicated that they intend to begin consulting with stakeholders on the BC Energy Step Code.

In August 2017, British Columbia joined Canada's federal government, represented by Natural Resources Canada, and other provinces and territories in endorsing the ""Build Smart: Canada’s Buildings Strategy."" The strategy commits signatories to develop and adopt increasingly stringent model building codes, starting in 2020, with the goal that provinces and territories adopt a “net-zero energy ready” model building code by 2030. In British Columbia, the BC Energy Step Code serves as a technical policy pathway for British Columbia to deliver on that goal.

As of early 2018, British Columbia is the only Canadian jurisdiction to have adopted a step code.

Three for All is a campaign to encourage local governments to consider adopting at least Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code. The campaign was created by an informal coalition of companies and non-profit organizations including The Open Green Building Society, The Canada Green Building Council, Integral Group, Passive House Canada, The Pembina Institute, and Recollective Consulting. The campaign´s primary purpose is to facilitate the sharing of accurate information about BC Energy Step Code adoption. 

The New Buildings Institute, a U.S. nonprofit organization advocating for improved energy performance in commercial buildings, describes a stretch code as ""a locally mandated or incentivized code or alternative compliance path that is more ambitious than the base code, resulting in buildings that achieve higher energy savings."" The institute says the codes provide an opportunity to train building and development communities in advanced practices before the underlying energy code is improved. They help accelerate market acceptance and adoption of more stringent energy efficiency codes in the future. Stretch codes can work in tandem with utility incentive programs. 

In November 2017, the New Buildings Institute released a set of model stretch building code strategies that target 20% better efficiency than current U.S. national building energy codes. The new 20% Stretch Code Provisions address design aspects such as envelope, mechanical, water heating, lighting and plug loads.

Other stretch codes are in place in the United States, in Massachusetts, Vermont, Oregon, New York, and California.",BC_Energy_Step_Code,148

"Schofield/Rothschild shootings

The Schofield/Rothschild shooting was a spree killing that occurred in Marathon County, Wisconsin on March 17, 2017. The perpetrator, Nengmy Vang, upset following a dispute with his wife, shot two employees at the bank where she worked, his wife's lawyer, and a police officer. After a three-hour standoff, Vang was shot by police officers and later died from his wounds.

Nengmy Vang phoned his wife, Naly, and demanded that she sign divorce papers within 24 hours, or he would kill her. He arrived at the bank a short time later, and asked Naly to sign the papers, saying ""Do you want to die now?"" in Hmong before exiting the bank to go to his car. According to Naly Vang, she knew that her husband kept a handgun in the car, and fearing for her life, fled to a nearby Subway restaurant. From there, she called police around 1 PM to report her husband's confrontation at the bank. Nengmy Vang then returned to the bank with a black bag, loaded his gun, and shot MSB employees Dianne Look and Karen Barclay, who later died from their wounds.

After shooting the bank tellers, Vang drove to the law offices of Tlusty, Kennedy and Dirks, where his wife's attorney, Sara Quirt Sann, worked. He held two people at gunpoint and demanded to be led to Quirt Sann's office, where he briefly confronted Quirt Sann before killing her.

Vang's final act was to return to his apartment in the town of Weston. As the police set up a safety perimeter around Vang's apartment, a shot rang out, killing Detective Jason Weiland. Weiland's killing began a three-hour standoff, where police and dispatchers attempted to coax Vang out of his apartment, but he refused. Vang called 911 twice during the standoff, expressing remorse for the murders and requesting that news stations send reporters so he could explain his actions. Police turned off power in the apartment, and tore down part of an exterior wall with an armored car, causing Vang to fire a warning shot. Claiming they saw Vang with a gun, an officer fired ""more than two dozen rounds"" into Vang's apartment, wounding him. Vang later died of his wounds at a Wausau hospital.


According to a Wausau Daily Herald interview with Naly Vang, her marriage to Nengmy had been fraught with trouble over its 25-year tenure. Naly Vang, a Laotian immigrant, met Nengmy when she was 16, and married a year later when Naly was 17 and Nengmy was 21. She had their first of seven children shortly after the marriage began. 

Around 2007, according to Naly, Nengmy began spending more time away from home, drinking heavily and leaving Naly to run the household. According to family friends, Nemgmy began dancing with other women at these parties, and after checking his phone bills (Naly dealt with the family's finances), she noticed several calls to another woman. According to court records obtained by the Herald, Nengmy was the target of frequent legal action over unpaid credit card balances, and Naly had attempted to rein in her husband's spending, to no avail. In May 2008, Nengmy called the police to report that his wife had broken several appliances while confronting him about a suspected affair. Police arrested Naly on a charge of noncriminal disorderly conduct, and she served no jail time.

Though the Vangs' marriage was not especially violent, Nengmy was extremely emotionally abusive, according to Mao Khang, a social worker at a Wausau-based domestic violence organization. Nengmy moved out of the family's house in 2015 and filed for divorce shortly after, hoping for a quick settlement. Nengmy wanted to use the Hmong clan system to resolve the divorce, but Naly wished to use the court system, as she felt it would give her more security towards receiving custody and child support payments. 

Naly believed that Nengmy was pursuing a relationship with a woman in Laos, as he told her he was planning on moving there after attempting to cash out some of his assets. According to Nengmy Vang's brother, he began acting ""crazy,"" and hit their mother after his separation from Naly; he also believed his brother to have a ""serious mental illness."" Police were called to the Vang residence 5 times in late 2015, when Nengmy attempted to remove his belongings, but no arrests resulted. Nengmy threatened that ""something bad would happen"" if Naly continued to request alimony payments.",Schofield_Rothschild_shootings,152

"Peter Jones (surgeon)

Peter Henry Jones (1 March 1917 – 30 July 1984), was born in Monmouth and is best known for his role in assisting Sir Clement Price Thomas in the pneumonectomy of King George VI in 1951. 

He subsequently remained professionally close to Price Thomas, pursuing a career in Cardiothoracic surgery.
Jones was educated in Pontypool at Haberdashers' Aske's West Monmouth School.

Qualifying in medicine from Westminster Hospital Medical School in 1939, Jones stayed on at the hospital to complete his junior house posts. Between 1942 and 1946, he joined the Royal Army Medical Corps as a regimental medical officer to a field artillery regiment in North Africa and Italy. He witnessed the Salerno landing and the attack on Monte Cassino. Declining an elevation in rank, he opted to endure the rest of the war along with his regiment. Returning to England in 1946, Jones continued his surgical training and passed the FRCS in 1948. Afterwards, he joined the surgical team under Sir Clement Price Thomas at the Brompton Hospital and Westminster Hospitals.

Baguley and Davyhulme Hospitals appointed Jones as thoracic surgeon in 1955 and Manchester Royal Infirmary took him on in 1960. Also, in 1960, Jones attended the Presbyterian Hospital in San Francisco to learn new techniques in open heart surgery. After spending six months with Dr Frank Gerbode, he returned to Westminster Hospital as thoracic surgeon. 

As Hunterian Professor, he gave a lecture on bronchial sleeve resection in 1958. 

In 1951, Jones spent three weeks as resident surgeon in Buckingham Palace. On 23 September 1951, whilst still in the palace, he had assisted Price Thomas with the pneumonectomy on King George VI’s lung cancer. In return, he was awarded the MVO. The surgery has since been researched and re-enacted by real surgeons in Stephen Daldry's The Crown (TV series).

Jones enjoyed fishing and antique clocks. Coronary artery disease and an illness resulting in loss of voice limited his activities and resulted in his premature retirement.

He died on 30 July 1984 leaving his wife Monica, two children and four grandchildren.",Peter_Jones__surgeon_,154
"Facing It

""Facing It"" is a poem by American poet and author Yusef Komunyakaa. It is a reflection on Komunyakaa's first visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa served in Vietnam from 1969 to 1970, during which time he wrote for army newspaper ""Southern Cross"". It is the second poem written by Komunyakaa about Vietnam. R. S. Gwynn has referred to the poem as “the most poignant elegy that has been written about the Vietnam War.” 

The poem was his second to deal with the topic of the Vietnam War. He first wrote a poem dealing with Vietnam fourteen years after returning from the war. ""Facing It"" was written approximately a year after visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Komunyakaa has said ""Facing It"" influenced the other poems of the collection in which it was first published, ""Dien Cai Dau"".

The poem concerns the speaker's visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, a black gabbro wall engraved with the names of American soldiers who died in the war. The wall is polished so that it is reflective.

Like jazz, the poem appears to be free of form, but it is in fact split into a verse-bridge-verse structure similar to many jazz songs. The first thirteen lines reflect on the speaker's reaction, and the final thirteen reflect on the reactions of others; these two sections are separated by a shorter section describing the act of finding and touching a name.

The poem is one of several by Vietnam veterans to deal with memorials. Andrew Palmer and Sally Minogue have contrasted the ""ambivalent response"" of ""Facing It"" with W. D. Ehrhart's ""The Invasion of Grenada"", in which the speaker rejects the idea of a Vietnam memorial and refuses to engage with ""...that
vast black wall of broken lives"".

The poem has been anthologized in a number of collections, and is perhaps Komunyakaa's best known work.",Facing_It,155

Agnes Oxenbridge (died August 4, 1480) and Elizabeth Etchingham (died December 3, 1452) have a joint memorial brass on the floor of the side aisle of The Assumption of Blessed Mary and St Nicholas church at Etchingham, England. The brass is in front of the monument to Etchingham's ancestors. The Latin inscription under Elizabeth Etchingham identifies her as the first daughter of Thomas and Margaret Etchingham. The text under Agnes Oxenbridge identifies her as the daughter of Robert Oxenbridge. Both Judith M. Bennett in ""The Lesbian Premodern"" than Alan Bray in ""Homosexuality in Renaissance England"" recognized the memorial brass like those made for a married couple and therefore think that the one between Oxenbridge and Etchingham was a particular friendship, probably a medieval example of Lesbian relationship.

Elizabeth Etchingham was the daughter of Thomas Etchingham II (1424/25 - 1486) and Margaret West, daughter of Reginald West, 6th Baron De La Warr. The monument to Thomas Etchingham I and his parents is in front of the memorial brass of his granddaughter.

Agnes Oxenbridge was the daughter of Robert Oxenbridge (died 1487), of Brede, and his wife Ann Livelode (or Anne Lyvelode) (died 1494).

The Etchingham and Oxenbridge families were deeply connected: Thomas Oxenbridge (died 1540) inherited both Etchingham and Mountfield manors from his mother Elizabeth, sister of Elizabeth Etchingham, born in 1460, 8 years after the death of her sister; she married in 1500 Goddard Oxenbridge (died 1531), son of Robert Oxenbridge and Anne Lyvelode, and therefore brother of Agnes Oxenbridge.",Agnes_Oxenbridge_and_Elizabeth_Etchingham,158

Serranus was the son of Lucius Nonius Asprenas, ordinary consul of AD 6 and Calpurnia L. Pisonis f., the daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus consul in 15. He is known to have two brothers, Lucius Nonius Asprenas suffect consul in AD 29, and Nonius Asprenas Calpurnius Torquatus.

Only one event is known of his life. On the morning that the emperor Caligula was assassinated, while offering a sacrifice Serranus had gotten some blood on his garments. Later that day, when Caligula had been murdered, the emperor's German bodyguards sought his assassin with their swords drawn. The first person they encountered was Serranus, and assuming the blood on his clothes was human summarily slew him. Then they cut off his head and, with those assassins they had found and killed, paraded about with it.

"Ngoc Lan Tran

Ngoc Lan Tran is a fictional character that appears in the 2017 US film ""Downsizing"" and is played by Hong Chau. In the satire film, Lan Tran is a supporting character and a Vietnamese political activist who is jailed and ""downsized"" (shrunken to five inches, or 12.7 cm, tall) by her country. In the process of escaping her country, she loses her left leg below the knee. The film was directed by Alexander Payne, who wrote the screenplay with Jim Taylor. Several critics complained that the role was an Asian caricature with the performance involving a heavy Vietnamese accent and broken English. Chau defended the portrayal and considered her character to be more layered. For her performance, Chau has been nominated for a Golden Globe Award and for a Screen Actors Guild Award for best supporting female actor.

In ""Downsizing"", Ngoc Lan Tran is a Vietnamese political activist who is jailed by her government and is ""downsized"" to a height of five inches. She and others attempt to smuggle themselves into the United States in a television box, but she becomes the sole survivor of the effort, losing her left leg below the knee. She becomes a house cleaner in Leisureland, and the film's protagonist Paul Safranek notices her and tries to help her with her prosthetic leg.

Hong Chau read that director Alexander Payne was developing a sci-fi satire, and since she had seen all of the director's films, she asked her manager for a copy of the script before knowing there was an Asian female role in the film. Chau submitted an audition tape, which the director received. They both met to discuss the role, and while the filmmakers conducted an international casting search, they ultimately cast Chau. Chau, who is of Vietnamese descent but grew up in the United States, worked on her character's accent by drawing from her personal experience with family members having been first-generation immigrants in the country. Chau also modeled her character after the writer Flannery O'Connor and the Honduran environmental activist Berta Cáceres. She also drew inspiration from Akira Kurosawa's 1965 film ""Red Beard"", which features a town doctor and his intern.

Chau also sought to portray the amputee character authentically by working with an amputee consultant based in Toronto, Canada. The consultant, who was an amputee like the written character, showed her around a rehabilitation center where she and other amputees had gone through rehab. She also practiced how to walk as if she had a prosthetic leg, and later a pegleg.

The actress said the director offered to let Chau change the character's name, but she declined, finding that past Asian characters had names easy for Americans to pronounce.

""Downsizing"" received ""generally favorable reviews"", according to the review aggregator website Metacritic, which scored the film 63 out of 100. It sampled 45 critics and identified 24 reviews as positive, 18 as mixed, and 3 as negative. Among the positive reviews, ""The Washington Post""s Ann Hornaday said Chau's performance was ""spiky, endearing, bracingly direct and touchingly expressive"". Alonso Duralde of ""TheWrap"" said, ""If there's a standout here, it's Chau, taking a character who could easily have been a saintly martyr and making her funny, bristly, moving and occasionally profane."" Richard Roeper, reviewing for the ""Chicago Sun-Times"", said, ""Hong Chau is brilliant as the fiery and funny and fantastically blunt Ngoc Lan."" Moira Macdonald of ""The Seattle Times"" called Chau's performance ""wickedly supersized"".

Among the mixed reviews, ""The Atlantic""s David Sims said, ""Chau's performance is energetic and heartfelt, but Ngoc Lan Tran seems to exist only to help Paul realize a truth about himself: He's not going to better himself simply by fleeing to a packaged 'perfect community,' and he needs to recognize the good in him to finally feel comfortable about his place in the world."" ""Time Out""s Joshua Rothkopf said, ""The introduction of a cringeworthy Vietnamese cleaning woman and ex-dissident (""Inherent Vice""s Hong Chau) borders on broken-English caricature."" Emily Yoshida, writing for ""New York"" magazine's blog ""Vulture"", said, ""There’s been some divided criticism over Chau's performance, which uses a heavy accent, but is also easily the most interesting and vibrant of the entire cast’s. Ngoc Lan is operating from an entire different scale of human experience than Paul, whose greatest struggle prior to going small was that he and his wife couldn’t afford a bigger house. But Chau does her best to find interesting nooks in the borderline saintly character Payne has written — Ngoc Lan is more than a little abrasive and unsentimental, which is the only redeeming aspect of her and Paul’s wholly unnecessary romance."" ""Vox""s Alissa Wilkinson said, ""Since ""Downsizing""s festival run, there's been criticism of Chau's character, who has a heavy accent that is played (quite a lot) for laughs."" Wilkinson said Damon's character was ""not a terribly compelling or interesting person"" especially next to ""Chau's character, who is a pragmatic spitfire"" and Waltz's character.

Among the negative reviews, RogerEbert.com's Sheila O'Malley found there to be ""a lot of problems"" with the story and said, ""Because Ngoc Lan is such a strong character, and Chau is so funny and strident and bossy, she takes over the entire film."" O'Malley found most side characters, including Ngoc Lan, to be characters ""more interesting and fleshed-out"" than Damon's main character.

Following early screenings, several critics and audience members criticized the character Ngoc Lan Tran as an Asian caricature, with the role involving a heavy Vietnamese accent and dialogue in broken English, a reaction that director Alexander Payne and distributor Paramount Pictures did not anticipate since it did not surface during preview screenings. ""The Guardian"" said the character's accent and dialogue were ""milked repeatedly for laughs"", and ""ScreenCrush"" called the role an ""icky, racist caricature"". ""The Independent"" reported, ""Some critics... have focused on her accent, claiming her broken English is nothing short of mockery."" The ""Los Angeles Times"" said, ""The character has also faced scrutiny from critics over the heavily accented broken English she speaks in a cadence that some say veers into stereotype before the script—and Chau's layered, dimensional performance—makes her a hero.""

In 2017, Chau was asked repeatedly about the criticism but defended the portrayal. She called the questions about her character's accent ""dehumanizing"" and said, ""When I look at my parents I don't see a stereotype."" She described her character as ""so multifaceted and complex and well-written"" and said the criticism was solely based on her character's accent. She later added, ""I didn't want the accent to be the thing people take away most from this movie. I wanted them to really see this woman. I wanted them to feel her heartbeat."" ""The New York Times"" said many reviewers agreed with her perspective and that the plaudits found her performance likely to result in an Academy Award nomination. In January 2018, Chau said, ""With the Vietnamese accent, it's usually because we tend to have service-oriented occupations. That brings up the race and class issue and inequality and discrimination. That's a lot to unpack, so it's not just about an accent being problematic. My character, and other minority characters in this story, are not there to prop up the white, male character and show him in this great, positive light. If anything, we're showing that he's part of the problem because he's not paying attention. I don't see anything wrong with that.""

""Salon""s John Semley wrote, ""What the reaction to ""Downsizing""['s Asian character] suggests are the real-world growing pains that accompany North America’s increasing reliance on the arrival of non-European immigrants."" Semley highlighted a 2010 study that showed that participants found statements with ""heavy Middle Eastern, European or Asian accents"" were less truthful than those from native English speakers. He said, ""It seems reasonable enough to believe that viewers calling out Alexander Payne, or Thai-Vietnamese actress Hong Chau herself, as troubling or in poor taste are in fact dealing with their own built-in cognitive mis-recognition, as they struggle with internalized accent discrimination.""

Hong Chau was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and for a Screen Actors Guild Award for best supporting female actor. ""Vanity Fair"" wrote, ""Chau steals every scene away from Damon and her other starry co-stars, including Kristen Wiig, Christoph Waltz, and Laura Dern.""",Ngoc_Lan_Tran,165

Nicolucci's first criminal conviction in Canada came in 1973 for drug possession, followed by possessing $2 million of counterfeit money in 1978. Nicolucci became a confidante of Vito Rizzuto, who went on a trip to Venezuela in 1984 where they met the allied Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan, regarded as drug specialists. That same year, a probe into Nicolucci's drug trafficking by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) found 12 kilograms of cocaine at Vancouver International Airport in false bottom suitcases intended for pick up by Montreal associate William Papier. The RCMP kept close surveillance on Nicolucci and Papier in Montreal through wiretaps, and even followed them by plane to Caracas, Venezuela where they received help from the United States Embassy in Venezuela, and bugged the mobsters hotel rooms. In 1985, the RCMP amassed enough evidence on Nicolucci and Papier, and the two were convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison in Montreal Superior Court in relation to the Vancouver haul; they appealed, but the verdict was upheld.

In 1991, serving less than half his sentence, Nicolucci was released on parole. Within months of Nicolucci's release, he was money laundering, moving $31 million through a phony currency exchange in Montreal secretly run by the RCMP in an elaborate sting operation. Officers traced a $1.7-million purchase of 280 kilograms of cocaine made by Nicolucci on behalf of Vito Rizzuto. However, Nicolucci refused to pay the debt to the Colombian Cali cartel, claiming the cocaine was of poor quality. As a result, the Colombians kidnapped Nicolucci from Castel Tina on August 2, 1994, a Montreal strip club he managed, and smuggled him across the border to Miami, Florida, and then into Colombia. With an international warrant for Nicolucci's arrest, the Colombian police found Nicolucci in a house in Cali, Colombia in February 1995. He was extradited back to Canada and brought back to Montreal on May 30, 1996. Nicolucci was found guilty of 437 charges for drug trafficking and money laundering, and sentenced to 19 years in prison.

"Mitsuhiro Matsunaga

Matsunaga began his career in FMW where he specialized in the deathmatch wrestling style and adopted it as his own trademark style. He competed in many infamous deathmatches in W*ING and high-profile feuds with Mr. Pogo, Freddy Krueger and Leatherface in many successful deathmatches earned him the moniker of ""Mr. Danger"". After working as W*ING's ace from 1992-1993, Matsunaga left the company and returned to FMW where he headlined the successful 1993 Year End Spectacular event against Atsushi Onita. After an alliance with Onita, Matsunaga formed the W*ING Alliance to feud with FMW and avenge the demise of W*ING from FMW. Initially considered to be Onita's successor as FMW's ace, Matsunaga was demoted from his role and failed to gain prominence in FMW and ultimately quit the company in 1996. He then joined BJW and helped the promotion revolutionize in deathmatch wrestling and became a two-time Deathmatch Heavyweight Champion in the company before quitting in 2001.

Matsunaga was initially trained in martial arts and worked for the World Karate Association (WKA) organization. He received the training of professional wrestling from fellow karateka Masashi Aoyagi and made his wrestling debut for Atsushi Onita's ""Grudge in Nagoya"" event promoted under the Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW) banner on October 6, 1989, by defeating Billy Mack. FMW would bring in martial artists and several fighters to combine matches between professional wrestlers and martial artists and Matsunaga would be roped in to tour with FMW for a few more shows as part of FMW's working partnership with WKA. Matsunaga headlined the ""Battle Creation"" event on December 10 at the Korakuen Hall in Tokyo by teaming with Jerry Blayman against Onita and Tarzan Goto in the company's first-ever barbed wire deathmatch and the first-ever deathmatch in Japan, which Matsunaga and Blayman lost. This match would set the stage for Matsunaga to establish himself as a deathmatch wrestler. Matsunaga then participated in the Battle Resistance Tournament on January 7, 1990, in which he defeated Katsuji Ueda via disqualification in the first round before losing to eventual winner Masanobu Kurisu in the quarterfinals.

Matsunaga left FMW after the partnership of FMW and WKA ended. He worked two shows for New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) in the summer of 1991 in which he traded wins with Masashi Aoyagi.

Matsunaga joined the newly upstart deathmatch wrestling promotion Wrestling International New Generations (W*ING) later that year, making his debut on September 20 by defeating Nobuhiro Tsurumaki. He was soon placed in a rivalry against the company's top villain Mr. Pogo and was pushed as the promotion's top fan favorite and the company's ace. After having faced off against each other in many tag team matches throughout the late 1991, Matsunaga and Pogo competed in their first singles match against one another in a Scramble Bunkhouse Barbed Wire Baseball Bat Deathmatch on March 8, 1992 at Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, which Matsunaga lost. Matsunaga rebounded by defeating Pogo in a Fire Deathmatch at ""One Night One Soul"". Matsunaga competed in many memorable deathmatches throughout 1992 and his rivalry with Mr. Pogo was considered a classic. He was then involved in a feud with Leatherface, to whom he lost in a Barbed Wire Deathmatch on October 28. He then suffered another loss against Leatherface in a Spike Nail Deathmatch at ""We Love W*ING"".

On April 3, 1993, Matsunaga won his first title, the promotion's World Tag Team Championship with Yukihiro Kanemura by defeating Freddie Krueger and Leatherface. He vacated the title only six days later to concentrate on his ongoing feud with Leatherface. On May 5, Matsunaga defeated Leatherface in a Spike Nail Deathmatch to gain his first singles win over his nemesis. Matsunaga then defeated Mr. Pogo in a Scramble Bunkhouse Deathmatch in their last meeting against each other in W*ING as Pogo would leave the company afterwards due to a contract dispute and return to FMW. Following Pogo's departure, Matsunaga continued to feud with Freddie Krueger, Leatherface and The Headhunters throughout the summer of 1993. He also made an appearance for Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in the United States on the August 31 episode of ""Hardcore TV"" by teaming with Miguelito Perez to wrestle The Headhunters to a double disqualification. He then toured Mexico to wrestle on two shows for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA). Matsunaga's final match in W*ING was a WarGames match, in which Matsunaga, Crash the Terminator and W*ING Kanemura lost to Freddie Krueger, Jado and Gedo at ""Best Champ"" on August 25.

Matsunaga followed his rival Mr. Pogo and left W*ING to return to FMW on September 15, 1993 as a villain. He teamed with Pogo to defeat Atsushi Onita and Mr. Gannosuke in a No Ropes Barbed Wire Street Fight Deathmatch. Matsunaga feuded with Onita throughout the fall of 1993 and he challenged Onita for the Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship in a highly-anticipated No Ropes Barbed Wire Deathmatch between the two at Year End Spectacular, which was promoted as the first-ever meeting between FMW's ace and W*ING's ace. Onita retained the title. After the match, Matsunaga made friends with Onita and turned fan favorite as he joined the FMW side to feud with Pogo and his entourage. At FMW 5th Anniversary Show on May 5, 1994, Matsunaga and Tarzan Goto unsuccessfully challenged Pogo and Hisakatsu Oya for the Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship. On July 31, Matsunaga teamed with Atsushi Onita to defeat Pogo and Oya for the tag team championship. As a result, Matsunaga renewed his W*ING-era rivalry with Mr. Pogo as the two clashed in a Street Fight Deathmatch at Summer Spectacular, which Matsunaga lost.

Matsunaga had gained fame for his deathmatch wrestling style and was considered by Onita to succeed him as FMW's ace after Onita's retirement at FMW 6th Anniversary Show but Matsunaga's box office drawing power was considered weak by management and the management had to change their mind. On September 7, former W*ING wrestler Yukihiro Kanemura debuted in FMW and quickly joined Mr. Pogo and convinced Matsunaga to join them but a reluctant Matsunaga did not agree to the offer. Matsunaga met Kanemura at a hospital where Kanemura was being treated for some burns suffered in a match and Onita got the pictures of the meeting and accused Matsunaga of having turned on FMW and joined Kanemura which upset Matsunaga and he broke up with Onita and turned on FMW to form W*ING Alliance with Kanemura and Pogo to become a villain and feud with FMW. At 6th Anniversary Show on May 5, 1995, the W*ING team of Matsunaga, Hido and Hideki Hosaka lost to Takashi Ishikawa, Apollo Sagawa and Kishin Kawabata. Matsunaga's stock began dropping in FMW and he was mainly utilized in the mid-card. Following Onita's retirement, Matsunaga and Pogo continued their rivalry to maintain the deathmatch wrestling in FMW.

Matsunaga would enter the Grand Slam Tournament for the vacant Brass Knuckles Heavyweight Championship, in which he scored eight points and lost his last match in the tournament against Hayabusa on September 24. After the loss, Matsunaga showed respect to Hayabusa and teased an alliance between FMW and W*ING as the two defeated W*ING Kanemura and Masato Tanaka in a tag team match on October 28. The four men formed an alliance while Super Leather and Hido grew upset at Matsunaga and Kanemura for turning on W*ING and joining FMW and the two joined Lethal Weapon. This turned out to be a ruse as Matsunaga turned on Hayabusa during a match against Mr. Pogo and Super Leather on November 20 and then Matsunaga and Kanemura turned on FMW and Leather and Hido turned on Lethal Weapon to reform W*ING. This was where W*ING regained its spot as the top villainous group and feuded with FMW and Lethal Weapon.

On February 23, 1996, Matsunaga, Hido and W*ING Kanemura lost to Masato Tanaka, Ricky Fuji and Tetsuhiro Kuroda in the first-ever WarGames match in FMW history. After the match, Victor Quinones debuted in FMW and led The Headhunters in attacking FMW and W*ING and then Quinones formed Puerto Rican Army in an attempt to take over FMW. FMW and W*ING joined forces and W*ING turned into a fan favorite group. Matsunaga lost to longtime rival Mr. Pogo in a Barbed Wire Double Hell Deathmatch on March 15. Matsunaga was initially scheduled to take on Abdullah the Butcher in a high-profile Barbwire Caribbean Glass Double Hell Deathmatch at FMW 7th Anniversary Show but then Cactus Jack was selected in Abdullah's place. Jack was contracted to World Wrestling Federation (WWF) at the time and WWF did not allow Jack to compete against Matsunaga due to Matsunaga's Hepatitis B and Matsunaga was pulled out of the match by FMW and replaced by W*ING Kanemura. Matsunaga would instead team with Hideki Hosaka and Hido to defeat Miguel Perez, Shoji Nakamaki and Toryu. This would be his last appearance with the company as Matsunaga left FMW due to being unhappy with his spot in the company.

Matsunaga debuted for the new rising deathmatch promotion Big Japan Pro Wrestling (BJW) on July 19, 1996 by teaming with Shoji Nakamaki to defeat Kendo Nagasaki and Seiji Yamakawa in a No Ropes Barbed Wire, Scaffold, Table and Barbed Wire Boards Elimination Deathmatch to begin feuding with Nagasaki. Matsunaga defeated Nagasaki in a singles match on August 5. At ""Summer Night Dream"", Matsunaga competed against Nagasaki in a high-profile Yokohama Amazon River Piranha and Barbed Wire Board Deathmatch, which Nagasaki won. The match earned critical acclaim and would become very popular in Japan and considered to be a pioneer in the popularity and success of deathmatch wrestling in Japan. It was considered by many to be the best deathmatch in Japanese wrestling history.

Daniel Massey of Bleacher Report commented ""The piranhas took a chunk out of Matsunaga’s chest and he looked in terrible pain when he left the arena. I don’t wish that on anyone, but he chose to wrestle there and in Japan—had they have been fobbed off with a rubbish ending, there would have been a riot. That does not mean I condone the actions, but that’s what makes it great. The final reason this match was the greatest Death Match of all time was because the wrestlers were so good. Matsunaga was already synonymous with the Death Match format and was considered a veteran, so this new concept of piranhas made it more exciting, as even he hadn’t encountered anything like it before. The two wrestlers had a certain chemistry in the ring, and to hold an audience for 20 minutes with a tank of piranhas in the middle of the ring is no easy feat.""

Ryan Byers of 411mania commented ""This probably seemed like a fairly revolutionary little match when it first occurred, and the stipulation upon which the match was built is something that has rarely if ever been duplicated. However, if you take away the piranha, there’s nothing that separates it from five hundred other deathmatches that we have seen throughout the years"", with ""The match is still well worth watching for curiosity’s sake, but I can’t imagine going out of your way to watch it if you’re interesting in seeing a top of the line deathmatch.""

Matsunaga competed in a variety of deathmatches during the early years of BJW and helped the promotion to make a mark in the deathmatch wrestling fame in Japan. In the summer of 1998, Matsunaga participated in a tournament to crown the inaugural Deathmatch Heavyweight Champion, losing to The Great Pogo in the final in a Glass and Fire Coffin Cremation Deathmatch on August 9. On August 23, Matsunaga defeated Pogo in a Glass and Fire Coffin Cremation Deathmatch to win the title. Matsunaga lost the title to Shadow WX in a 3-Way Board Alligator Deathmatch on September 23. On August 19, 2001, Matsunaga defeated Zandig in a 200 lighttubes and thumbtack and glass board deathmatch to win his second Deathmatch Heavyweight Championship. Matsunaga lost the title back to Zandig at ""Ante Up"". This was his last appearance with BJW as he left the company after losing the title.

Matsunaga competed as a freelancer in the Japanese independent circuit during the last few years of his career. On September 16, 2002, Matsunaga attacked Mammoth Sasaki with a baseball bat during Sasaki's match against Hisakatsu Oya for the Wrestlings Marvelous Future (WMF) promotion. A match was made between Matsunaga and Sasaki which stipulated that if Matsunaga won then he would be allowed to compete in WMF and deathmatches would also be legal in the company and if he lost then he would be banned from competing in WMF. The match took place on September 30, which Matsunaga lost. Matsunaga would make appearances for Pro Wrestling Zero1 between 2005 and 2008. On December 23, 2009, Matsunaga lost to Akitoshi Saito in his retirement match at a Pro Wrestling NOAH show.

"Paulette Gebara Farah

Paulette Gebara Farah (20 July 2005 – 22 March 2010) was a four-year-old Mexican female child with physical disability and language disorder who was found dead in her own room in her family's home in Huixquilucan, State of Mexico, on 31 March 2010.

Paulette presumptly disappeared from her home on 22 March 2010, her family began a campaign through media, advertisements, and social networks to find Paulette. Paulette's body was “accidentally” found in her own room wrapped in sheets between the mattress of her bed and the foot, the same place where her mother had offered interviews, experts came from various agencies and even dogs trained to find the whereabouts of the girl. However, no one noticed the existence of the corpse, until it was discovered on March 31 due to the smell of putrefaction. Her death was ruled ""accidental"" by Alberto Bazbaz, attorney general for the state of Mexico, who said his investigation concluded that Paulette died during the night after she turned herself around in bed, ended up at the foot, and died by a suffocation described as ""mechanical asphyxia by obstruction of the nasal cavities and thorax-abdominal compression"".

Paulette's body was buried at Panteón Francés in Mexico City in 2010, before her remains were exhumed and cremated on May 3, 2017, after authorities considered that the remains were no longer objects of evidence for the investigation of the case.

On the night of Sunday 21 March 2010, Paulette arrived from Valle de Bravo to her home, located in Huixquilucan, accompanied by her sister and her father, Mauricio Gebara. The mother of the girls, Lizette Farah, awaited their arrival to tuck them in and prepare them for sleep, she did so and it was the last day she saw little Paulette.

The next morning, Erika, one of Paulette's two nannies, came to wake her up to take her to school and noticed her disappearance; she notified Mrs. Lizette and began the search in the building located on Hacienda del Cuervo street. Mauricio Gebara notified his sister of the disappearance of her daughter, who informed the authorities of Huixquilucan of the case, later, the mayor notified the Attorney General of State of Mexico.

Paulette didn't appear, her family had searched throughout the apartment and the building. There were no signs of theft or kidnapping, the plates were intact, as were the windows and all access to the home. The housing complex had surveillance, but nobody saw anything, she couldn't go out alone, they said, because she had a motor and language disability.

In the afternoon, the Attorney General of the State of Mexico disseminated a poster with a photo of Paulette and some data that gave account of their age, appearance and physical deficiencies. The aunt of Paulette, Arlette Farah, sent mails and uploaded the photo of the girl to social networks, where the news spread with great speed and netizens unleashed a massive search. In the evening, Lizette Farah called the alleged abductor, asked that her daughter be returned to her that she be left in a shopping center or a crowded place and assured, on television, that there would be no reprisals. Lizzete did not cry, but she looked nervous in the videos. After the notification, she distributed flyers with Paulette's face, she ordered to put spectaculars, advertisements on television and public transport.

Mauricio also appeared in the media asking to be returned to his daughter, he remembered that he had gone out to work on the morning of Monday, 22 March, when Paulette had apparently disappeared. On March 29, The Attorney General of the State of Mexico announced that Mauricio Gebara and Lizette Farah, parents of Paulette, as well as the sisters Erika and Martha Casimiro, Paulette's nannies, would be rooted in falsehoods and inconsistencies in the statements.

On March 30, Paulette's parents spent a few hours at the Procuraduría Mexiquense and then they were transferred to a hotel where they would fulfill their roots, that same day, experts from the unit placed blankets at the home to carry out the reconstruction of the events with the presence of the parents.

On March 31 at around 2:00 am, the body of Paulette was found dead in her own bedroom, where previously experts had come with trained dogs and where the mother of the girl had given interviews. Paulette had died of an accident by ""mechanical asphyxia due to obstruction of the nasal cavities and thorax-abdominal compression"", said Alberto Bazbaz.

An autopsy revealed that Paulette have eaten food at least five hours before her death, another point that indicates the report regarding the external appearance is that the corpse had two segments of rectangular adhesive cloth in vertical position on both cheeks, in addition to signs of a blow to the left elbow and knee, the findings also revealed that in the body of the child missing on 22 March and who was found dead on 30 March at night, there were no signs of physical or sexual violence. The same necropsy established that her death was recorded between five and nine days before the analysis was made, which was reported on 31 March.

On April 3, Paulette's mother, Lizette Farah, initiated an amparo proceeding against the arraigo as she claimed that she had not intervened in the events that caused her daughter's death. Specialists indicated that the woman suffered from personality disorders. During the procedure, Mrs. Farah became subject to indictment. On April 4: A judge granted freedom to Paulette's parents and nannies. Mauricio Gebara left the hotel where he was staying at 10:20; Lizette Farah, main suspect, at 11:00 hours, and nannies Erika and Martha Casimiro, at the noon time. None could leave the country because the inquiries continued. On April 5: in separate interviews, Mauricio Gebara and Lizette Farah entered into a war of verbal accusations, while Lizette claimed that her husband blamed her for Paulette's death, he said that the death could not have been just an accident and that he could not put his hands in the fire for his wife.

On April 6, Paulette's body was buried at Panteón Francés in Mexico City, the funeral procession was headed by the girl's mother; the Gebara family did not go to the burial for an ""agreement"".

On April 7, The Gebara family denied Lizette Farah to see her other daughter, Lizette, seven years old, who stayed with her father's family since Sunday, April 4. On May 10, The Attorney General of the Federal District, who also collaborated in the case at the request of her counterpart in the State of Mexico, granted the custody of Paulette's sister to her mother, Lizzette Farah, who brought a complaint against her husband demanding custody of the girl. On May 26, although Alberto Bazbaz defended the investigation and conclusions of the case, he resigned his position as head of the Attorney General of the State of Mexico saying that a Procuraduría needs confidence to act effectively and the dependency to his office had lost it due to the questioning of his actions in the investigation of the death of Paulette Gebara Farah.

More than seven years later on May 3, 2017, Paulette's body was exhumed from her grave and cremated since authorities considered that her remains were no longer objects of evidence for the investigation of the case.

Paulette's nannies Ericka and Martha Casimiro, ensured that the girl's body was not under her mattress, with Casimiro stating;

And Ericka stating;

During the investigation of the case, a recording between the mother of Paulette, Lizette, and her then 7 year older sister with the same name as her mother was released in which she recommends her daughter to don't say anything of Paulette's disappearance so they were not be blamed, with the following words:

At first Lizette denied this saying that the recording was edited so it sound like if she was saying her other daughter to hide any information, but later she accept this were the words she said to her sating ""I had the conversation with my daughter, but not in the context they showed it.""

In 2010 via YouTube, a video entitled 'El extraño caso de la pijama de Paulette' (Spanish for: 'The strange case of Paulette's pajamas') with photographs of her body dressed in pajamas with reindeer figures, taken by experts and disseminated in some media, seconds later, they show a video of an interview with the mother of the little girl made by the program Hechos de Fuerza Informativa Azteca in which the same pajamas appear on the girl's bed.",Paulette_Gebara_Farah,178

Kurt Selchow (born 28 May 1886 in Oppeln, Upper Silesia, Germany) was a Minister () and Director of the Z Branch, the Signal Intelligence Agency of the German Foreign Office () before and during World War II. 

His father was Hugo Selchow. His wife was Erna Selchow and he had one daughter called Gitta. He was educated in Oppeln until 1906 when he became a soldier. He was initially assigned to the Infantry, then in 1912 he was transferred to Signal Corps (""Nachrichten Telegrafen Bataillon"") in Frankfurt (Oder). 

He served with the German Army of World War I as a signal officer with the troop. Selchow stated that even in the midst of World War I, he pointed out to the Chief Signal Office that much of the work being done in the German Army Signal Corps belonged properly to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs because of its diplomatic nature. The Chief Signal Officer did not agree with this statement and during World War I much of the work done by the Army was diplomatic in nature. Directly after the war, Selchow entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he organized the cipher bureau. He brought with him several soldiers who had been with him during World War I. These were Schauffler, Paschke, Zastrow, Brandes, Hoffman and Kunze. He is listed as a Principal Foreign Office Specialist (""Vortragender Legationsrat"") on November 1, 1935, with the rank of Minister in 1945. In mid-April 1947, Selchow moved to Wedel in Hamburgh. After the war Selchow maintained contact with some of his colleagues. Little is known about his abilities, but statements from personnel in other cipher bureaus imply that he was jealous and secretive. His Pers Z S staff characterized him as a ""competent administrator"" who knew little about cryptography and cryptanalysis. Selchow was somewhat of a Europhile and detested the Nazi Party. With the advent of Adolf Hitler in 1933 and Hermann Göring's Forschungsamt cipher bureau encroached upon the field of the Pers Z S, which was the interception and processing of diplomatic ciphers. Selchow at the time fervently wished to resign by was persuaded to stay by von Bülow, who until 1938 was Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, when he died. When Joachim von Ribbentrop, the new Foreign Minister, he lost a lot of supervisory power, and was restricted in duties. He was forced to join the Nazi Party in 1941. During World War II, he had no exact knowledge of the messages passed between different parties, and took no part in any matters pertaining to diplomacy. He remained head of the cipher bureau until May 1945.",Kurt_Selchow,183
"Garlic oil

Garlic oil is the volatile oil (essential oil) derived from garlic. It is usually prepared using steam distillation, and can also be produced via distillation using ether. It is used in cooking and as a seasoning, a nutritional supplement, and also as an insecticide.

Garlic oil is typically prepared using steam distillation, whereby crushed garlic is steamed with the resultant condensation containing the oil. Garlic oil contains volatile sulfur compounds such as diallyl disulfide, which is the ""most abundant constituent"" of essential garlic oil. Steam-distilled garlic oil typically has a pungent odor and a yellow-brownish coloration. Its odor has been attributed to the presence of diallyl disulfide. To produce around 1 g of pure steam-distilled garlic oil, around 500 g garlic is required. Steam-distilled garlic oil has around 900 times the strength of fresh garlic, and around 200 times the strength of dehydrated garlic.

Ether can also be used to extract garlic oil. A type of garlic oil involves soaking diced or crushed garlic in vegetable oil, but this is not pure garlic oil; rather it is a garlic-infused oil.

Garlic oil is used as a nutritional supplement, and is sometimes purveyed in the form of capsules, which may be diluted with other ingredients. Some commercial preparations are produced with various levels of dilution, such as a preparation that contains 10% garlic oil. Some herbal folklore sources have stated that garlic oil possesses antifungal and antibiotic properties. It is also purveyed in health food stores as a digestive aid.

It can also be used as an insecticide, whereby it is diluted with water and sprayed on plants.

Stabilized garlic flavor blend is a proprietary mixture of dehydrated garlic powder infused with garlic oil, which increases the flavor of the garlic powder.

Garlic-flavored oil is produced and used for cooking and seasoning purposes, and is sometimes used as an ingredient in seasoning mixtures. This differs from essential garlic oil, and typically involves the use of chopped, macerated or crushed garlic placed in various vegetable oils to flavor the oil.",Garlic_oil,184
"John Primrose (brewer)

John Primrose (c. 1803 – 28 November 1876) was a Scottish distiller and brewer who had a substantial career in South Australia. He was the founder of the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, the colony's first successful brewery.

Primrose was the son of a distiller in Cambridge, near Alloa. He was educated at the High School in Edinburgh, and on leaving school he joined his father's establishment, where he remained for some time, gaining sound practical and scientific knowledge of the arts of brewing and distilling. He gained further experience managing a distillery for the Messrs. Shea, of Belfast, then that of Beamish, in Cork. He remained with them for several years, only leaving them to establish a brewery on his own account on the Isle of Man.
He was then attracted to Australia, with the prospect of managing a large established distillery in Sydney.

Primrose arrived in South Australia aboard ""Ariadne"" in August 1839 and somehow never made it to Sydney. 
Shortly after his arrival he set up a distillery in partnership with John Richmond. 
After carrying it on for about two years he ceased operation on account of the Government demanding payment of duty upon all spirit manufactured in the colony, at the same rate as if it had been imported. 
Primrose then turned his attention to brewing, and in 1841 founded the Union Brewery in Rundle Street, which he carried on until a few years before his death, transferring the management to his nephew William Ross Sawers (c. 1839–1911) and Arthur Rait Malcom (c. 1847–1890), his son-in-law.

His remains were interred in the West Terrace Cemetery.

"Swedish history of ideas

The discipline Idé- och lärdomshistoria, translated as History of Science and Ideas, is an important part of the humanities faculties in most Swedish universities, most notably Stockholm, Uppsala, Lund, Gothenburg, Umeå and Södertörn. It is a broad field of study that often involves cross disciplinary research between intellectual history, history of science, medicine or philosophy, conceptual history, history of education and media history. It is taught in Universities at undergraduate and graduate levels, and is also an active field of research. The annual journal Lychnos publishes the current research of the discipline. 

The discipline was founded in the early 20th century. It has become commonplace to distinguish between three distinct phases in 20th-century intellectual ideas: history of ideas, social history, and cultural history. These concern, respectively, the investigation of independent unit ideas, the social conditions of knowledge production, and the cultural-literary technologies and practices by which intellectual authority arises. The transition towards a quantitative social history took place during the 1960s as an attempt to broaden intellectual history, “which had lost itself in flights of idealist abstraction, underestimated the importance of material factors in shaping the human past, and ignored the plight of ordinary people.” A second transition took place in 1980s when social history was criticized for a lack of political self-reflexivity.

The Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905, sparked a renewed need to define Sweden as a cultural and political entity. The rapid expansion of the Swedish Academy of Sciences offered the institutional space wherein this need could be further cultivated: nationalist narratives of Swedish scientific personas were produced on an extensive scale. This genre provided in Sweden the first production of a history of science. Two apt examples of this practice are Eneström’s Bibliotheca mathematica (1984 – 1914) and Linnésällskapets Årsskrift (1918).
After the events of the first world war, the supposed progressive direction of science was discredited, and its historical study lost interest. It was not until the 1930s that the interest for a new history of science increased in Sweden. Important figures within this revival were Eneström, Arrhenius, von Hofsten, Nordenskiöld, Oseen, and, most famously, Johan Nordström. In 1932, Nordström was appointed the first chair of History of Ideas (Idé- och lärdomshistoria) in Uppsala. Influenced by figures ranging as widely as Dilthey, Burckhardt, Comte, Buckle, Tannery, and Sarton, Nordström argued for a new social historical understanding of the history of science. History of science was considered at the base of history of ideas, Nordström writes:
[…] history of science […] should set out to depict scientific life in its totality and in its context, to focus on the essential features of progress, the basic opinions, the emergent new ideas, the great revolutionizing discoveries, and seek to establish their importance as factors shaping the cultural process.
In 1934, Nordström founded the Swedish History of Science Association and its annual journal Lychnos, in which he was involved as editor. He continued to hold his Chair in Uppsala until 1957.

What later became known as the Nordström school in Sweden was marked less by strict methodology than by a general sensitivity to social historical circumstances of scientific knowledge production. His students, most notably Sten Lindroth and Henrik Sandblad, worked towards a further dissemination and cultivation of the field. The former succeeded to Nordström in Uppsala in 1957, whilst the latter went on to found a Chair in the History of Ideas at the University of Gothenburg. In 1966, Rolf Lindborg founded a Chair of History of Ideas in Lund. Four years later, another chair was founded in Umeå by Gunnar Eriksson, and, lastly, in 1978, Nils Runeby founded a similar chair in Stockholm. 
Among these different departments, two general shared perspectives stand out. First, their investigations go beyond the history of science and extend into history of humanities, religion, and a wider History of ideas. Secondly, most of the historians involved have no formal background in the natural sciences, and favour an externalist, social-contextual approach to knowledge production.

During the ‘70s and ‘80s, several Swedish History of Science and Ideas scholars were public intellectuals and engaged in the public debate, most notably Sten Lindroth, Tore Frängsmyr, Henrik Sandblad, Sven-Eric Liedman, Karin Johannisson and Ronny Ambjörnsson. 
At present, a number of subfields have become particularly prevalent within the history of ideas in Sweden. Most notably, media history, Cultural history, History of medicine, History of science, history of concepts, and History of theology have received increased attention. Today, history of science and ideas is practiced in Sweden at most of the universities with several hundred active scholars. The journal Lychnos continues to be an important place for intellectual exchange within the subject in Sweden.",Swedish_history_of_ideas,186

"Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification System

The Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantifications System (POP-Q), is a system of assessing the degree of prolapse of pelvic organs to help standardize diagnosing, comparing, documenting, and sharing of clinical findings. This assessment is used the most frequently. In the UK urologists can specialize in in female urology, The Baden–Walker Halfway Scoring System is used as the second most used system. More research publications related to pelvic organ prolapse use the POP-Q as the measure of pelvic organ prolapse.

Pelvic organ prolapse, when assessed using the POP-Q, identifies the prevalence of pelvic organ prolapse to be up to 50% while diagnosis by symptoms has a prevalence of 3–6 %. Some advocate that the system of assessment be modified.

The POP-Q was developed in 1996 and it quantifies the descent of pelvic organs into the vagina. The POP-Q provides reliable description of the support of the anterior, posterior and apical vaginal wall. It uses objective and precise distance measurements to the reference point, the hymen. Cystocele and prolapse of the vagina from other causes is staged using POP-Q criteria can range from good support (no descent into the vagina) reported as a POP-Q stage 0 or I to a POP-Q score of IV; which includes prolapse beyond the hymen. It also used to quantifies the movement of other structures into the vaginal lumen and their descent.

The POP-Q assessment tool measures nine points in the vagina. The hymen is the reference point to which the other points are compared. The prolapsed organs are measured in centimeters to the hymen. The measurements are taken when the Valsalva maneuver is performed by the woman while in the dorsal lithotomy position. The anatomical landmarks used are anterior vaginal wall, cervix, hymen, perineal body, total vaginal length, posterior vaginal wall and posterior fornix. A three by three centimeter grid is used to record the proximal and distal numbers. The information on the grid is translated to the appropriate stage of prolapse.

The evaluation of pelvic organ prolapse includes other diagnostic tests in addition to the POP-Q. These can be:
In the US, greater than 200,000 surgeries are performed each year for pelvic organ prolapse. Examples of pelvic organ prolapse are cystocele, rectocele, urethrocele, enterocele and sigmoidocele. Cystocele is the most common. This system of assessing pelvic organ prolapse is currently used widely in China and the US.

Other assessment tools are used to determine the impact of pelvic floor prolapse. These are Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ),The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the shorter forms PFIQ-7 and PFDI-20.",Pelvic_Organ_Prolapse_Quantification_System,191

"Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota

""Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota"" is a poem by American poet James Wright. It is one of his best known poems, partially because of the tonal contrast between the content of the poem and its final line.

The poem was first published in ""The Paris Review"". It was later featured in a short story by Ann Beattie also published in ""The Paris Review"". The poem was included in Wright's collection ""This Branch Will Not Break"".

The poem is a description of a pastoral scene from the perspective of a person in a hammock. 

Much of the critical attention focused on the poem has concerned the last line. Dan Piepenbring, writing for ""The Paris Review"", summarized the criticism in a 2010 article:

Since [the poem's publication], that last line has inspired reams of analysis and debate—is it a lament? Is it a joke, a kind of boast? Did Wright intend to undercut or to bolster his pastoral scene with it? Could it be a winking response to Rilke, whose “Archaic Torso of Apollo” concludes with the imperative “You must change your life”?

Thom Gunn, in 1964, dismissed the line as ""...certainly meaningless. The more one searches for an explicit meaning in it, the vaguer it becomes. Other general statements of different import could well be substituted for it and the poem would neither gain nor lose strength."" Robert Bly, a friend of Wright, wrote in defense of the line a year later, and criticized Gunn for being unable to relate to the emotion expressed by the line.

David Mitchell has said that the line is a happy one, writing: ""...I hear him exhale it with a wry laugh"".

The line is discussed in Ann Beattie's short story ""Yancey"".

Wright acknowledged that he was influenced by Chinese poetry in writing ""Lying in a Hammock..."" in an interview with Dave Smith. This influence has been discussed by academics including Sven Birkerts.

The poem has been widely anthologized. It is one of David Mitchell's favorite pieces of writing.",Lying_in_a_Hammock_at_William_Duffy_s_Farm_in_Pine_Island__Minnesota,194

Bargain Hunt, formerly Essex Bargain Hunt, is an American Discount store chain. Founded in 2004, Bargain Hunt is headquartered in La Vergne, Tennessee with retail locations in Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas.

Essex Technology Group - Bargain Hunt's parent company was founded in the year 2000 in Nashville by Robert Echols and Phil Pfeffer. They started off the company as a wholesaler of closeout goods. The company bought overstock and excess inventory goods from big box retailers and sold them. Initially, the focus was on electronics and computers.

The first store was opened in 2004 in Nashville and was known as Essex Bargain Hunt. The company also began an online store selling directly to retail customers from its original Nashville location. The strategy was to sell items that were too big or expensive to sell online.

After a successful run, Essex launched the Bargain Hunt superstores - using locations abandoned by stores such as Staples and Circuit City. The name was later changed to Bargain Hunt.

Bargain Hunt opened its first store in Nashville in the year 2004 and went on to expand in Southern and Midwest United States. The chain operates more than 80 stores in 10 states as of 2017. In 2015, Thomas H. Lee Partners acquired a majority stake in the retail chain.

Bargain Hunt stores are typically around 20,000 - 25,000 sq ft. in size and sell products such as electronics, movies and music, furniture, home improvement, clothing, footwear, jewelry, toys, health and beauty, pet supplies, sporting goods and fitness.

The stores sells name brands at a deep discount of 30% to 70% on regular prices and plays in the extreme value retail space. The store also utilizes a discounting program that drops the prices on items by specific percentages depending on the time they have been on shelves. The discount varies from 10% for newly shelved products to 90% for products in store for a longer time. These discounts are given in addition to the already marked down prices.

"Erricka Bridgeford

Erricka Bridgeford is an American activist from Baltimore. She worked to get Maryland's death penalty law repealed in 2013, and organized two 72-hour ""Ceasefire"" weekends in 2017 in the hope of reducing violence. She was named 2017's Marylander of the Year by the ""Baltimore Sun"".

Bridgeford was born on October 9, 1972, the oldest of four children. She grew up in Normount Court, a housing project in West Baltimore. Her family was close-knit, and her parents, she said in an interview, were like ""the Huxtables of the ghetto,"" serving as surrogate parents to other young people in the neighborhood. The area was poor but not plagued with violence until the 1980s and 90s. Since then she has lost a brother, a stepson, a cousin, and several friends to gun violence. 

As a result of Amniotic Band Syndrome, Bridgeford was born without a right hand, and with four fingers on her left hand.

Bridgeford began her career working for an organization devoted to infant wellness. In 2001 she trained as a volunteer at the Baltimore Community Mediation Center; two months later she was hired, and in 2002 she became their director of training. She provides training to the 18 community mediation centers in Maryland, as well as to state agencies and organizations. 

Bridgeford has been involved in community activism since the late 1990s. The death of her brother David in 2007 inspired her to focus on ending violence.

Bridgeford began advocating for repeal of the death penalty in Maryland in 2009. Along with several other survivors of homicide victims, she testified before the Maryland legislature, spoke repeatedly to the press, and shared her personal story at rallies and other events. She argued that justice could not be gained through revenge, and that the death penalty was a form of revenge. ""It's not justice to me to have another dead body in place of my brother's dead body,"" she said in an interview. Bridgeford believed the death penalty only brought more pain and failed to honor the victims; she suggested to a CBS reporter that the money Maryland saved by repealing the death penalty could be used to provide services to the victims' families. Senator Bobby Zirkin later cited the testimony of homicide survivors such as Bridgeford as a major factor in his decision to support the repeal. The death penalty was repealed in Maryland in 2013.

Bridgeford worked with a coalition of murder victims' family members and organizations to support Maryland House Bill 0355 (Programs for Survivors of Homicide Victims). The bill was designed to identify survivors of homicide victims as a group of victims, and to ensure yearly funding. The bill passed and was approved by the governor on April 14, 2015. Maryland became the second state in the United States to provide specific funds and resources to murder victims' family members.

The same year, Senator Lisa Gladden introduced Senate Bill 0512, which called for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to include a survivor of homicide. At the hearing, Gladden said that she was inspired by Bridgeford's advocacy for homicide survivors, and believed that someone who had lost a loved one to homicide should be included on the Board that makes decisions about providing resources to victims' families. The bill was signed into law on April 14, 2014.

The idea for a ceasefire weekend was first suggested by hip-hop artist Ogun, who was working with Bridgeford on a rally for the anti-violence group 300 Men March. In 2017, with Baltimore's murder rate climbing, Bridgeford revisited the idea with Ogun and several other activists and began planning. The idea was to see if the community could go 72 hours without a shooting, stabbing, or any other kind of violence; their motto was ""Nobody kill anybody."" 

The first Ceasefire took place the first weekend in August, and drew thousands of residents to special community events and activities. The second Ceasefire weekend, held in November, was even larger. Events included basketball tournaments, a yoga class, art exhibits, a sip-and-paint, a peace walk, and a campout. 

Both Ceasefire weekends were marred by killings, but Bridgeford's efforts started a grassroots movement and ""awakened a sense that the cycle of killing can be broken and that the power to do it lies in our own hands."" She was named Marylander of the Year ""for bringing hope to Baltimore in some of its bleakest hours.""",Erricka_Bridgeford,198

Prasophyllum subbisectum, commonly known as the Pomonal leek orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to Victoria. It has a single, thin tubular leaf and up to fifteen small, greenish-brown to brown flowers well-spaced along a thin flowering stem. It is only known from a small area around Stawell.

""Prasophyllum subbisectum"" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single tube-shaped leaf long and wide. Between seven and fifteen flowers are well-spaced along a flowering stem long which reaches to a height of . The flowers are greenish-brown to brown and as with others in the genus, are inverted so that the labellum is above the column rather than below it. The dorsal sepal is lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long, about wide and curves downward. The lateral sepals are long, about wide and curve backwards. The petals are long, about wide and pointed. The labellum is greenish or pinkish, egg-shaped, about long and wide and turns sharply upwards near its middle. There is a shiny green or brown, deeply channelled callus along the centre of the labellum, extending almost to its tip. Flowering occurs in October and November.

""Prasophyllum subbisectum"" was first formally described in 1936 by William Henry Nicholls and the description was published in ""The Victorian Naturalist"" from a specimen collected near Pomonal. The specific epithet (""subbisectum"") is derived from the Latin word ""sectus"" meaning ""cut"", with the prefixes ""sub-"" meaning ""somewhat"" and ""bi-"" meaning ""two"" or ""double"".

The Pomonal leek orchid mostly grows in heathy woodland near Stawell.

In 2010, ""P. subbisectum"" was recorded in four populations with a total of about 130 plants. It is listed as ""Endangered"" under the Commonwealth Government ""Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999"" (EPBC) Act and the Victorian ""Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988"".

Kaat Tilley grew up in Kapelle-op-den-Bos and as a child, she was fond of fairy tales. The inaccessibility, strength, beauty and fragility of the fairy-tale figure Snow White became her trademark. Tilley would regularly refer to this in her later visual work.

Tilley studied at Sint Lucas in Brussels and learned the technique of painting there. Tilley was a former student of the Antwerp Fashion Academy. She graduated there cum laude with the theme for her final collection ""Mahler and Venice "".

Tilley was known for her romantic to fairytale clothing. In 1990 she designed a jewelery collection. In 1993 she signed the costumes for the film "" Antoine "". Her creations are midway between fashion and art. She dressed among others Diana Ross, Barbra Streisand, Naomi Campbell, Melanie Griffith and Halle Berry.

In the meantime she became an established name, witness her retrospective exhibition at the Gaasbeek Castle in the autumn of 2005.

In 2007 Tilley kept on her living and working area in Asbeek (Asse) an exhibition and sale of a large part of her prototypes and paintings. She claimed that she was first a painter and secondly a fashion designer. Art and beauty were inextricably linked throughout her career.

She had a gallery in the Royal Gallery of the Brussels Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert. She designed costumes for Zap Mama and Madredeus. On a commercial level, she struggled with a few setbacks. After a bankruptcy in 2009 she returned two years later with a collection furniture, fabrics, lighting, jewelery and pictorial work. She designed the clothes for the opera La Traviata. The last ten years of her life she lived and worked in a converted watermill in Asbeek.

"Somewhere Over the Rainbow (Harold Mabern album)

Somewhere Over the Rainbow is an album by pianist Harold Mabern. It was recorded in 2005 and released by Venus Records.

The album was recorded on November 11, 2005, at The Studio in New York. It was produced by Tetsuo Hara and Todd Barkan. The personnel are Harold Mabern (piano), Dwayne Burno (bass), and Willie Jones III (drums).

All of the compositions are by Harold Arlen. Mabern commented that, ""I've always studied him because his music is very bluesy. And you don't really have to do anything to his music but just go ahead and play it."" Jones uses brushes on most of the tracks. ""A Sleeping Bee"" gets a ""gospel-inflected soul-jazz treatment"". ""This Time the Dream's on Me"" has ""a hip Latin vamp to introduce a soul-jazz-infused arrangement"". Mabern's arrangement of ""Savannah"" begins as a calypso and then shifts into hard bop. ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" was released by Venus Records.",Somewhere_Over_the_Rainbow__Harold_Mabern_album_,211
"Starry Internet

Starry Internet is a fixed wireless broadband Internet service provider (ISP or WISP) operated by Starry, Inc., using millimeter-band LMDS connections, sometimes categorized as 5G fixed wireless, to connect its base stations to customer buildings.

Starry, Inc. was publicly announced in January 2016 by Chaitanya ""Chet"" Kanojia, who had previously founded Aereo. , it is providing commercial service to a limited number of apartment buildings in the Boston area for $50/month per apartment, promising 200Mbit/s upload and download speeds. , Starry was based in Boston, had about 100 employees, and had raised $63 million of funding. Kanojia claims that Starry's capital cost will be only $25 per home, as compared to $2,500 for cable.

Starry's system operates on the 38.2 GHz and 38.6 GHz bands, connecting its base stations (""Starry Beam"") to receivers on individual buildings (""Starry Points""). Each base station covers a radius of 1.5 km. Signal propagation is near line-of-sight, not penetrating buildings and windows, and is degraded by foliage or rain, so Starry directs its signal using Multi-user MIMO phased array antennas, and can take advantage of reflections. 

The base station redistributes its signal within a building using Starry's own Wi-Fi router (""Starry Station"").

Analysts are mixed about Starry's prospects. Some point to the failure of Clearwire (which operated WiMax on the 2.5 GHz band), or to technical challenges: ""The physics are tough to overcome, and technology has been slow to improve here."" Others note that if the expected low fixed costs per user are achieved, ""they could profitably offer competitive broadband speeds for a fraction of the current price of wired broadband"".

In January 2018, Starry announced they would be rolling out a beta version of their internet service in Los Angeles and Washington, DC later in the month.

"Cyrtoctenus

Cyrtoctenus is a genus of prehistoric eurypterid classified within the family Hibbertopteridae. The genus contains six species, ranging in temporal range from the Devonian to the Carboniferous.

""Cyrtoctenus wittebergensis"" is one of the few eurypterids known from the southern hemisphere, where eurypterid finds are rare and usually fragmentary.

""Cyrtoctenus"" was a gigantic Hibbertopterid eurypterid, with ""C. wittebergensis"" reaching lengths of around 1.5 meters. The anterior movable spines of the distal podomeres on the second, third and fourth prosomal appendages were modified to form ""fingers"" associated with fixed combs developed as modifications of the posterior spine.

""Cyrtoctenus"" had further adaptations towards sweep-feeding than other hibbertopterids, with its blades modified into comb-like rachis that could entrap smaller prey or other organic food particles. With its coxae being large, it is likely that ""Cyrtoctenus"" would also feed on relatively large invertebrates when able to.

It is believed that some of the genera within the Hibbertopteridae represent synonyms of each other. Four of the genera in the family, ""Campylocephalus"", ""Hastimima, Dunsopterus"" and ""Vernonopterus"" are clearly hibbertopterids but known from very incomplete specimens. Further discoveries may point to that some of them are synonymous with either ""Hibbertopterus"" or ""Cyrtoctenus"".

Furthermore, ""Cyrtoctenus"" and ""Hibbertopterus"" might represent different ontogenetic stages of each other, where rachis would have developed in the later moult stages. This would also explain why smaller ""Hibbertopterus"" specimens are more complete than the fragmentary remains known of ""Cyrtoctenus"", as the majority of ""Hibbertopterus"" specimens would represent exuviae whilst ""Cyrtoctenus"" specimens represent actual mortalities susceptible to scavengers.

The species currently seen as valid species of the genus are:",Cyrtoctenus,213

"Harry Driggs

Harry Driggs (November 3, 1935 — July 14, 2007) was an American artist, graphic designer, political activist and underground cartoonist who designed the leafy graphic logo for California's Green Party. In June 1967 the San Francisco Diggers published a small edition of his pioneering 28-page underground comic ""The Life and Loves of Cleopatra"", an obscene travesty inspired by the Elizabeth Taylor film ""Cleopatra"", which they gave away free in the Diggers' Free Store at the corner of Cole and Carl in Haight-Ashbury. This small first edition was issued anonymously without the knowledge or permission of Driggs, who left for New York City where he joined the staff of the radical newspaper ""The National Guardian"". When he returned to San Francisco in 1969 he authorized Don Donahue to bring out a new, redrawn edition under the pseudonym ""R. Diggs"". A third edition was self-published by Driggs in 1977 and Rip Off Press put out a reformatted fourth edition with new comix by Driggs in 1991.

He was a longtime resident of San Francisco, where he worked in advertising as a graphic designer and art director. He served as art director for the underground newspaper ""Good Times"" where he recruited Trina Robbins to draw for the paper. In the 1980s he joined the newly-formed Green Party, for which he designed posters, newsletters, and other materials, and did design work for local non-profits. He also contributed to ""Rip Off Comix"" and Last Gasp's"" Anarchy Comics"". Two volumes of his political cartoons were published by Rip[ Off Press in 1977 and 1979, under the title ""Great Diggs"".",Harry_Driggs,216
